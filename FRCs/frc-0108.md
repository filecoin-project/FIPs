# FRC-0108: Filecoin Snapshot Format

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the FIP.-->

Downloading F3 finality certificates from scratch takes a long time and increases the p2p network bandwidth usage.
An F3 snapshot is proposed to be included in the Filecoin CAR snapshot to reduce F3 catchup time and p2p network bandwidth usage on bootstrapping
a Filecoin node with a Filecoin snapshot.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 words) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->

The Filecoin ecosystem existed for years without specifying the snapshot format. That was fine until the advent of F3 and the resulting need to update the format in a coordinated way.

This document outlines:
- "v1": the original accepted format found implementations through 2025 and 
- "v2": the extension to v1 with an F3 snapshot as a raw data block, and changing CAR roots to be a CID that points to a CBOR-encoded Filecoin snapshot header struct.

## Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for FIPs that want to change the Filecoin protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the FIP solves. FIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

The time cost and the network bandwidth usage for a new Filecoin node to catch up with all F3 finality certificates grow over time, which delays the readiness of the F3-aware V2 RPC APIs. By embedding an F3 snapshot into the current Filecoin CAR snapshot, both can be vastly reduced at the cost of a slightly increased Filecoin CAR snapshot size.

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any current Filecoin implementations. -->

We propose the below changes to the Filecoin CAR snapshot format.

- Change CAR root to be a CID that points to a CBOR-encoded [`SnapshotMetadata`](#snapshotmetadata) struct that is stored as the first data block in the CAR.
- Store the raw [`F3Data`](#f3data) bytes as the second data block in the CAR when `F3Data != nil` in the metadata.

### SnapshotMetadata

```go
type SnapshotMetadata {
	Version       uint64 // required, format version for SnapshotMetadata. Only "2" is supported since "v1" was implied in the original format that predates `SnapshotMetadata`.
    HeadTipsetKey []Cid // required
    F3Data        *Cid  // optional, points to F3Data structure. The only supported codec is "RAW" (0x55).
}
```

### F3Data

An F3 snapshot contains one header block and N data blocks (where N>0) in the below [CARv1](https://ipld.io/specs/transport/car/carv1)-like format:

`[Header block] [Data block] [Data block] [Data block] ...`

A header block is a CBOR-encoded [`F3SnapshotHeader`](#f3snapshotheader) with a length prefix in the below format:

`[varint-encoded byte length of "CBOR-encoded F3SnapshotHeader"] [CBOR-encoded F3SnapshotHeader]`

A data block is a CBOR-encoded [`FinalityCertificate`](#finalitycertificate) with a length prefix in the below format:

`[varint-encoded byte length] [CBOR-encoded FinalityCertificate]`

Notes:
- `FinalityCertificate`s should be ordered by `GPBFTInstance` in ascending order for sequential validation and intermediate power table calculation. This also ensures deterministic generation of F3 snapshot from a given F3 finality certificate chain.
- The first and last `FinalityCertificate` instances should match those in the header, respectively.
- This [CARv1](https://ipld.io/specs/transport/car/carv1)-like format is ideal for dumping blocks via streaming reads as the Header can be loaded first and minimal state is required for ongoing parsing.

### F3SnapshotHeader

```go
type F3SnapshotHeader struct {
	Version           uint64
	FirstInstance     uint64
	LatestInstance    uint64
	InitialPowerTable gpbft.PowerEntries

### Filecoin snapshot v1 format

We define the existing Filecoin snapshot format as v1 here for future reference.

Filecoin snapshot v1 is in [CARv1](https://ipld.io/specs/transport/car/carv1/) format. 

The roots array in the `CarHeader` stores the tipset keys of the chain head in the snapshot. 

The data blocks are chain IPLD blocks generated in a deterministic depth-first traversal order during chain export. Thus a snapshot is deterministic for a given chain head and the number of state trees to include. (The details of the chain traversal algorithm can be found in Filecoin node implementations)

```go
type CarHeader struct {
  version Int
  roots [&Any]
}
```

## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All FIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The FIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. FIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->

- A Filecoin node should try to read a snapshot CAR in the proposed format. A failure to successfully decode the block referenced as the CAR's single root using the schema presented above, a snapshot reader may fallback to the old format and maintain backward compatibility. Additional failures to decode original snapshot format would indicate a fatal error.
- CLI options for implementations like Forest, Lotus and Venus should remain unchanged to make it transparent to the node users.
- The code change in all Filecoin nodes should be shipped with a network upgrade, and the Filecoin snapshot providers should only start publishing with the new format after the mainnet upgrade finishes to avoid potential errors during snapshot import for node users. That is to say:
	- Before NV27,
		- a node reads both v1 and v2 snapshots
		- a node generates v1 snapshot by default
		- node provides publish and host v1 snapshots.
	- After NV27,
		- a node reads both v1 and v2 snapshots
		- a node generates v2 snapshot by default
		- node providers publish and host v2 snapshots.

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for FIPs affecting consensus changes. Other FIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->

## Security Considerations
<!--All FIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. FIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. A FIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->

This change has minimal security implications as the additional F3 data are also stored in the node database, unencrypted. Key considerations:

- **Integrity**: The F3 snapshot can be validated.
- **Performance** The F3 snapshot data blocks can be read, validated and imported in a stream, without requiring to hold the entire finality certificate chain in the RAM. To facilitate this, it might require some new API(s) in the CAR reader package.
- **Cyclic structure** Not applicable. The F3 snapshot does not build any cyclic graph during import and export, only a single block(certificate) is required to be held in the RAM.

The change does not introduce new attack vectors or modify existing security properties of the protocol.

## Incentive Considerations
<!--All FIPs must contain a section that discusses the incentive implications/considerations relative to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for incentive discussion. A discussion on how the proposed change will incentivize reliable and useful storage is required. FIP submissions missing the "Incentive Considerations" section will be rejected. An FIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Incentive Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->

Node users should experience faster F3 bootstrapping time and less network bandwidth usage.

## Product Considerations
<!--All FIPs must contain a section that discusses the product implications/considerations relative to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for product discussion. A discussion on how the proposed change will enable better storage-related goods and services to be developed on Filecoin. FIP submissions missing the "Product Considerations" section will be rejected. An FIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Product Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->

Nodes starting from a snapshot should not rely on the certificate exchange protocol to catch up with the F3 data because we expect this will get slower over time. A slow F3 catchup time leads to, e.g.

- delay in the readiness of F3-aware RPC APIs

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any core FIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the FIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->

## Future Work
<!--A section that lists any unresolved issues or tasks that are part of the FIP proposal. Examples of these include performing benchmarking to know gas fees, validate claims made in the FIP once the final implementation is ready, etc. A FIP can only move to a "Last Call" status once all these items have been resolved.-->
