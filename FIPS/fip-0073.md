## Simple Summary

Currently, actors can delete themselves and send away their funds (to another actor) in a single operation. Unfortunately, this doesn't behave exactly like a _normal_ transfer of funds and introduces some complexity. We propose to simplify this "self destruct" mechanism by requiring users to send away any remaining funds first through a normal send, if desired.

## Abstract

Currently, the `self::self_destruct(beneficiary)` syscall transfers funds to some designated beneficiary before deleting the actor. We propose to remove the beneficiary from this syscall. Instead, the user will be able to pass a boolean to specify if any remaining funds should be burnt, or if the self-destruct operation should fail if there are any remaining funds.

## Change Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for FIPs that want to change the Filecoin protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the FIP solves. FIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

Unfortunately, `self_destruct` transfers funds in a non-standard way. I.e., it doesn't send a message, it just implicitly transfers the funds. This means:

1. This transfer won't show up in traces. This is fixable without a FIP, but adds some complexity to parsing traces.
2. It won't automatically create the beneficiary, unlike a normal `send` (requires a FIP to fix). This is a foot-gun because it behaves differently from how `send` currently behaves.
3. If we ever decide to implement some mechanism whereby actors can execute code whenever they receive funds, this syscall, as currently implemented, could pose an issue. E.g., it might cause reentrency on self-destruct.

We could fix the first two issues instead of removing the beneficiary and there may be ways to work around the third issue. However, that would add unnecessary complexity. This complexity is _unnecessary_ as there's already a way to transfer funds (the `send` syscall).

Instead, this FIP proposed to fix this issue by reducing complexity: the `self_destruct` syscall will be responsible for deleting the actor and that's it. Sending away funds will be the responsibility of the actor.

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Filecoin implementations. -->

We replace the `self_destruct(beneficiary: Address)` syscall with a `self_destruct(burn: bool)` syscall. This syscall will:

1. Check if the actor is executing in "read-only" mode. If so, the syscall will fail as it currently does.
2. Check if there are remaining funds. If there are:
    1. If `burn` is `false`, this syscall will fail with an [`IllegalOperation`](https://docs.rs/fvm_sdk/latest/fvm_sdk/sys/enum.ErrorNumber.html#variant.IllegalOperation) error number (0x2).
    2. If `burn` is `true`, the funds will be transferred to the burnt funds account (charging no additional gas).
3. Proceed to delete the actor.

## Design Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

### No Charge Burn Funds

There's no additional gas charge to burn funds as:

1. We'll already charge to update the actor being deleted.
2. We don't charge to update the burnt-funds actor per [FIP-0057](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0057.md).

So any additional cost for burning funds is negligible.

### Burning v. Erroring

We considered two potential implementations of `self_destruct`:

1. The first we considered was to always return an error when `self_destruct` is called and there are remaining unspent funds in the actor.
2. We also considered always burning funds.

We settled on a boolean flag because neither option is strictly superior. Passing a flag forces the user to make an explicit decision.

### Account Abstraction

If we ever introduce account abstractions, accounts may want to "delete" themselves. It's unclear whether or not we even want to _allow_ this however, if we do, we'll run into an issue: the account will be refunded for any unused gas _after_ it has self-destructed. If a beneficiary is specified in `self_destruct`, this is less of an issue as the unspent gas can simply be sent to said beneficiary.

However, I'm not particularly concerned about this for a few reasons:

1. It's unclear whether or not we'll even allow this.
2. This is already an issue even with the syscall as specified today as the beneficiary may self-destruct, leaving the FVM no place to send the refund from unused gas.
3. Said refund will usually be negligible.

## Backwards Compatibility

This FIP changes a syscall used by exactly one actor: the payment channel. Changing the payment channel actor to use the new syscall is trivial and already implemented in https://github.com/filecoin-project/builtin-actors/pull/1362.

## Test Cases

The implementation includes unit tests.

## Security Considerations
<!--All FIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. FIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. A FIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->

This FIP has negligible risk from a security standpoint.

## Incentive Considerations
<!--All FIPs must contain a section that discusses the incentive implications/considerations relative to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for incentive discussion. A discussion on how the proposed change will incentivize reliable and useful storage is required. FIP submissions missing the "Incentive Considerations" section will be rejected. An FIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Incentive Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->

This FIP has no impact on network incentives.

## Product Considerations
<!--All FIPs must contain a section that discusses the product implications/considerations relative to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for product discussion. A discussion on how the proposed change will enable better storage-related goods and services to be developed on Filecoin. FIP submissions missing the "Product Considerations" section will be rejected. An FIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Product Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->

This FIP removes a potential foot-gun (`self_destruct` not behaving like `send`) and simplifies the FVM a bit.

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any core FIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the FIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
