# FIP-0091: Freeze stfil user’s transferred asset address

## Simple Summary

Currently, more than 4.5 million FIL of Stfil user assets have been transferred to “unknown addresses” - https://filfox.info/en/address/f410falck3ysg7e2k4outtq2r24ytd66cuddydnoga6a,  which most likely belong to the police. 

According to "customary practice" these assets will soon be sold off in the secondary market, and all investors and community members should pay attention and take action. 

I propose that FF and PL should make freezing this account and formally consider how to implement it and take action!
