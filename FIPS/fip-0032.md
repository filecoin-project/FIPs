# FIP-0032: Gas model adjustment for non-programmable FVM

## Simple Summary

This FIP is part of a two-FIP series that adjust the gas model of the Filecoin
blockchain in preparation of user-programmable actors. This FIP focuses on
attaining high-fidelity gas accounting under the Wasm runtime that built-in
system actors will migrate to as part of FIP-0030 and FIP-0031. It does not
cover upcoming system features like actor deployment, actor loading, memory
management, and more. Those will be addressed in a subsequent FIP that focuses
on gas model changes to support user-programmability.

## Abstract

With the arrival of the Filecoin Virtual Machine, the Filecoin network will gain
the capability to run untrusted code in the form of user-defined actors.
However, the current gas model is designed strictly for predefined, trusted
code. In order to maintain network security guarantees, the gas model needs to
evolve to accurately charge for computational instructions and resource usage of
actor logic.

This FIP expands the current gas model by introducing a new gas category to
account for the real compute cost of the logic performed by every actor in the
system. It also rearchitects IPLD state management gas, adjusts the actor call
fee to account for Wasm invocation container mechanics, and revises the fees for
syscalls that traverse the extern boundary (FVM <> Node).

This is the first FIP out of a two-FIP series to revise the gas model as a
result of the introduction of the Filecoin Virtual Machine.

This FIP is designed to accompany FIP-0030 and FIP-0031 under the same network 
upgrade. Taken together, these three FIPs represent the theory and process of 
change for introducing an FVM with non-programmable smart contracts. 

The second gas change FIP will be proposed and considered at a later date in 
order to support the introduction of user-programmable smart contracts during 
phase 2 of FVM roll-out. 

## Change Motivation

Gas is an essential mechanism to (a) compensate the network for the computation
performed during transaction execution, and to (b) restrict the compute capacity
of blocks to achieve a designated epoch time (30 seconds).

Today, Filecoin determines the amount of gas a transaction consumes by
intercepting specific operations and actions, and applying gas explicit gas
charges on them. Concretely:

- On including a chain message, variable on the length of the message.
- On returning a value, variable on the length of returned payload.
- On performing a call, dependent on the type of call (simple value transfer, or
  other).
- On performing an IPLD store get, fixed amount.
- On performing an IPLD store put, variable on block payload size.
- On actor creation, fixed amount.
- On actor deletion, fixed amount.
- On cryptographic operations:
    - On signature verification, variable on signature type and plaintext
      length.
    - On hashing, fixed price.
    - On computing the CID of an unsealed sector, variable on proof type and
      piece characteristics.
    - On verifying a seal, variable on the seal characteristics.
    - On verifying a window PoSt, variable on the PoSt characteristics.
    - On verifying a consensus fault.

None of these gas charges accounts for the costs of the execution of the actor’s
compute logic itself. This results in an incomplete resource accounting model.
So far, the network has coped without it because:

1. The cost of built-in actor logic is negligible when compared to the cost of
   the above operations, most of which are triggered through syscalls.
2. Only pre-determined, trusted logic runs on chain in the form of built-in
   actors.
3. Technical limitations. Prior to the FVM (FIP-0030, FIP-0031), there was no
   portable actor bytecode whose execution could be metered identically across
   all implementations.

With the ability to deploy user-defined actors on the FVM, these assumptions no
longer stand and it becomes important to start tracking real execution costs
with the highest fidelity possible, to preserve security guarantees, and to
compensate the network for the logic it executes.

## Specification

Here’s an overview of proposed changes to the existing gas model. We explain
each one in detail in the following sections.

- Introduce Wasm bytecode-metered execution gas.
- Adjust the *actor call* fee, to account for new call dispatch overhead.
- Rearchitect the IPLD state IO fees.
- Revise fees for extern-traversing syscalls.

### Wasm bytecode-metered execution gas

We introduce a new category of gas. Execution gas is charged per Wasm
instruction. Every Wasm instruction has a predefined amount of execution units
associated with it.

Every Wasm instruction expends a flat 1 execution unit, except the following
structural Wasm instructions: `nop`, `drop`, `block`, `loop`, `unreachable`,
`return`, `else`  and `end` . These instructions expend 0 execution units
because either they do not translate into machine instructions by themselves, or
they are control flow instructions with no logic to evaluate.

**Pricing formula**

The conversion of Wasm execution units to Filecoin gas units is at a predefined
ratio of `<<TODO: currently benchmarking>>`. This equivalence has been
calculated by performing extensive benchmarks, with the goal of honouring the
invariant baseline target of 10 gas units/ns of wall clock time[^1].

Both the pricing policy for Wasm instructions and the conversion rate need to be
assessed and revised continuously as technology improves (e.g. Wasm compilers
and processors). The ongoing goal is to sustain high execution fidelity.

### Call gas fee

In Filecoin network version 15 and earlier, the call gas fee is higher for value
transfers than it is for actor code invocations. This may sound
counterintuitive, but it follows the fact that the call fee has to cover the
full validation and state update cost of the transaction, because these
transactions don’t invoke actor code. Conversely, the call fee for an actor
invocation represents only the dispatch effort, hence why it’s lower.

With FVM actors, the call cost structure changes. For actor code invocations, a
Wasm-based invocation container needs to be instantiated, and parameters need to
be serialized and inserted into the IPLD blockstore. In other words, there is
more work to do that than previously, and therefore the fee is adjusted upward.

**Pricing formula**

TODO: benchmarking
```

### IPLD state management fees

Currently, IPLD block read incur a fixed fee, and IPLD block writes incur a
variable fee, dependent on the number of bytes written.

With the FVM, IPLD state I/O is managed through five syscalls, with the
specified overhead and pricing:

- `block_open`: looks up the supplied CID, loads the block from the state
  blockstore into the FVM kernel’s block cache, reports its size and codec. It
  returns a numeric block handle.
    - Overhead: This syscall traverses the FVM<>client boundary via an extern in
      order to query the state blockstore. This leads to disk IO with associated
      read amplification. The bytes returned through the extern are copied into
      the FVM’s memory so that the buffer can be reclaimed by the client side;
      thus there is an alloc and memcpy cost. The bytes are retained in memory
      until the actor call finishes and the invocation container is dropped, and
      thus the actor is charged for this memory usage.
- `block_read`: takes a block handle and an output buffer, and copies the
  block’s data from the FVM kernel’s block cache into the actor’s memory.
    - Overhead: This syscall resolves inside the FVM and doesn’t traverse the
      FVM<>node boundary. The overhead is that of a memcpy operation.
- `block_write`: takes some block data and a codec, and merely copies it to the
  FVM kernel’s block cache. It returns a numeric block handle.
    - Overhead: This syscall resolves inside the FVM and doesn’t traverse the
      FVM<>node boundary. It involves a memcpy to a buffer that is retained
      until the actor call finishes. The bytes are retained in memory until the
      actor call finishes and the invocation container is dropped, and thus the
      actor is charged for this memory usage.
- `block_link`: computes the CID of a block, and commits the block to the state
  blockstore.
    - Overhead: This syscall traverses the FVM<>client boundary via an extern in
      order to write to the state blockstore (although this is deferred until
      the machine flush). This leads to disk IO with associated write
      amplification. The bytes are copied over to the client’s memory, thus
      there is an alloc and memcpy cost. Computing the CID involves a hashing
      operation (akin to the hash syscall, but without the syscall overhead).
      Because the CID is returned to the actor via an output buffer, there is
      another memcpy involved.
- `block_stat`: returns the length and the codec of a block.
    - Overhead: This syscall resolves inside the FVM and doesn’t traverse the
      FVM<>node boundary. It performs a map lookup and returns an integer tuple.

**Pricing formulae**

- `block_open` (extern-traversing): `<<TODO>>`
- `block_read`: `<<TODO>>`
- `block_write`: `<<TODO>>`
- `block_link` (extern-traversing): `<<TODO>>`
- `block_stat`: `<<TODO>>`

### Extern-traversing syscall fee revision

Some syscalls cannot be resolved entirely within FVM space. Such syscalls
need to traverse the "extern" (FVM<>node) boundary to access client
functionality.

Depending on the languages of the client and the FVM implementation, traversing
this boundary may involve foreign-function interface (FFI) mechanics.

That is indeed the case with the reference client (Lotus) and the reference FVM
(ref-fvm). Not only is this the worst case scenario, but it's the most common
scenario today given the client distribution of the network.

In accordance to the design principle of high-execution fidelity, we propose
that the gas fees account for the cost of the FFI boundary.

The associated costs are:

- data structure translation between representations, including serialization
  costs.
- context switch.
- the memory overhead on both sides of the interface.
- the amortized (opportunity) cost of dedicating OS threads.
- the amortized garbage collection or deallocation costs once the extern
  concludes.
- function lookup and dispatch.

**Pricing formulae**

The pricing formulae for extern-traversing syscalls are:

- `get_chain_randomness`: `<<TODO>>`
- `get_beacon_randomness`: `<<TODO>>`
- `verify_consensus_fault`: `<<TODO>>`. This is a fixed cost that covers all blockstore operations,
  signature verifications, and other logic needed to resolve whether a consensus fault has occured.
  Note that differs from network v15 and earlier, where the cost is variable depending on the exact
  blockstore operations performed.
- Blockstore operations: already absorbed in the fees specified above ("IPLD
  state management fees").

## Design Rationale

To simplify community discussion and align with the FVM deployment roadmap, all
changes related to new system features related to user-programmable actors are
kept out of scope of this FIP. This set of changes covers only the technological
transition to a Wasm runtime for built-in actors. This FIP will be followed by
another FIP introducing the former.

Concerning the design of each individual change, the specification section
elaborates on overhead that is being accounted for and the variables that make
up every pricing formula.

## Backwards Compatibility

The data model by which gas allowance and usage is represented in external
interfaces (gas limit, gas used, etc.) remains unchanged. However, the same
transaction made before and after this FIP will, with very high likelihood,
result in different values for *gas used*. Transactions sitting in the mempool
at the activation epoch of this FIP will need to be re-estimated and replaced.

## Test Cases

Testing for this FIP involves two efforts:

1. An updated corpus of FVM-compatible [test
   vectors](https://github.com/filecoin-project/fvm-test-vectors) with the new
   gas model.
2. The testnet plan laid out in FIP-0031.

## Security Considerations

TODO draft.

## Incentive Considerations

With the introduction of execution gas to account for real execution cost, actor
compute logic will no longer be exempted from gas charges, thus resulting in a
net increase in gas expenditure in the network.

## Product Considerations

The cost every actor method changes upwards as a result of this FIP.
Furthermore, by charging for actor logic itself, methods that are more
computationally intensive may have their price structure changed significantly.
These two implications may transpire as changes in onboarding, power maintenance,
deal-making, and other features that are noteworthy from a product perspective.

`<<TODO: More data will be added to this section once benchmarking has been
completed>>.`

## Implementation

For clients relying on the reference FVM implementation
([filecoin-project/ref-fvm](https://github.com/filecoin-project/ref-fvm)), the
implementation of this FIP will be transparent, as it is self-contained inside
the FVM.

## Footnotes

[^1]: The baseline target itself determined by the need to sustain a 30 second
    epoch frequency, with a 6 second block propagation time, under these
    circumstances, which represent the absolute worst possible scenario:
      - Block gas limit of 15B gas units.
      - Attaining the maximum winrate at an epoch (11).
      - No duplicated messages across blocks in a tipset.
      - 100% saturation of every block with compute.

    The choice of 10 gas units/ns as a baseline implies a block validation time
    of 1.5s and a fully saturated tipset validation time of 16.5s (given that
    message and block execution cannot be parallelized).
