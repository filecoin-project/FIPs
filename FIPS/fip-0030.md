## Simple Summary

User-programmability is the ability to deploy and run arbitrary user-provided
code on some infrastructure, in this case a blockchain network.

Today, the Filecoin blockchain lacks on-chain user-programmability. This FIP is
part of a series that aims to introduce this capability.

A change of this magnitude impacts many components. Concretely:

1. The chain state layer, to store and load user-provided code.
2. The execution layer, to compile/interpret user-provided code, run state
   transitions involving such code, and verify the results.
3. The gas model, to secure the network and modulate chain capacity
   demand/supply dynamics in the face of user-programmable code.
4. The preexisting baseline protocol, to facilitate programmability against
   system functionality.

This FIP focuses on (1) and (2). The remaining points are out of scope of this
FIP, and will be addressed by subsequent proposals.

## Abstract

We specify the Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM), an IPLD-ready Wasm-based
execution layer capable of running arbitrary user-provided code. The FVM
replaces the [existing non-programmable execution layer][Specs/Legacy-VM], now
termed _Legacy VM_.

The logic of native actors (the equivalent of smart contracts in Filecoin) is
deployed as Wasm bytecode. Foreign actors targeting non-Filecoin runtimes such
as the Ethereum Virtual Machine are also supported through runtime emulation.

We provide a reference architecture for the FVM, and explain its various
components: (a) Machine, (b) Call Manager, (c) Invocation Container, (d) Kernel,
(e) Syscalls, and (f) Externs. We define the contract that actor code must
adhere to, the catalogue of available syscalls, the mechanics of IPLD state
manipulation, and further technical details

This FIP introduces the technical foundations of the FVM. It is accompanied by
two subsequent FIPs building on it: [FIP-0031][FIPs/FIP-0031] and
[FIP-0032][FIPs/FIP-0032]. Respectively, these propose: an atomic switch from
the legacy VM to a non-programmable version of the FVM, and an iteration on the
gas model to account for the execution footprint of the new VM runtime.

## Change Motivation

The desire for user-programmability in Filecoin is pronounced and
well-recognized. It is the key to unlock enormous latent potential, as it
enables permissionless community-driven innovation on the Filecoin network.

Some of the envisioned benefits include:

- The proliferation of innovative, trustless solutions in user space.
  - The ability to program behaviors on top of the existing Filecoin primitives
    confers new degrees of freedom to developers and increases the potential for
    innovation.
  - Some examples include: decentralized compute, Data DAOs, Layer 2 networks,
    cross-chain bridges, alternative storage markets, programmable storage,
    collateral loan markets, and more.
- The migration of functionality from system space to user space, thus resulting
  in a lower dependence on built-in actor evolution, which is largely
  bottlenecked on the Core Devs and the FIP process.
- The emergence of an ecosystem of composable and stackable building blocks and
  primitives exposed through standardised interfaces, enabling the construction
  of richer, composite, interconnected solutions.
- Unification of built-in actors across implementations to speed up protocol
  development.
- Ability to conduct protocol upgrades that modify built-in actor logic through
  on-chain governance processes.
- Potential for more areas of the Filecoin protocol to migrate to Wasm space
  (e.g. block validation, fork choice rule, etc.), it becomes possible to deploy
  protocol changes as Wasm modules to all clients, conditional upon on-chain
  voting.

## FVM specification

This section provides a fundamental definition of the Filecoin Virtual Machine
(FVM). It is intended to act as a baseline for future FIPs to enhance and
evolve, as new capabilities, innovations and mechanisms are worked out.

_Writing style_

The FVM is a system under development, and some aspects are still in flux. For
this reason, this spec combines two styles to provide a well-rounded picture:

- Normative style, for concrete behaviors, rules, interfaces and types that we
  propose to introduce imminently. _Conveyed by present tense._
- Directional style: lays out the thinking for upcoming behaviors, rules,
  interfaces, and types, without mandating concrete technical choices yet.
  _Conveyed by future tense and/or speculative language._

### Reference implementation

[filecoin-project/ref-fvm][Repos/filecoin-project/ref-fvm] is a reference
implementation to serve as a companion to this specification.

### Context and VM interface

In the Filecoin blockchain, the virtual machine (VM) is the component in the
execution layer responsible for applying transactions over a state tree. These
transactions are encapsulated in messages. There are two kinds of messages:

- Explicit messages are sent by secp256k1 or BLS account actors, appear on-chain
  when executed, and carry a signature to prove their authenticity. 
- Implicit messages are generated by the system, do not appear on chain, and
  they carry no signature. Examples include cron ticks and reward cycles.

A VM is instantiated with these input parameters:

```rust
/// These code samples are simplified with respect to the actual implementation in ref-fvm.
let machine = Machine::new(
    epoch,             // chain epoch at which to execute messages
    base_fee,          // base fee currently in effect
    base_circ_supply,  // base circulating supply
    nv,                // network version
    state_root,        // root CID of the initial state tree
    blockstore,        // blockstore to load and save state objects during execution
)
```

Messages are then applied to the `machine`. Every application generates a return
object containing at least a message receipt, a miner penalty, and a miner tip.
Implementations may return extra data such as diagnostics info, backtraces, or
gas traces.

```rust
let ApplyRet { receipt, penalty, tip } := machine.apply_message(msg1);
let ApplyRet { receipt, penalty, tip } := machine.apply_message(msg2);
let ApplyRet { receipt, penalty, tip } := machine.apply_message(msg3);
```

The message receipt is recorded on chain. It holds the exit code of the
transaction, the gas used, and (optionally) return data only if successful.

The penalty and the tip are values used by the cryptoeconomic rules of the
protocol to calculate the block reward for the block producer.

Once the caller has finished applying all messages, it flushes the machine. This
computes the final state root. Depending on implementation, this operation may
also commit newly written blocks to the blockstore.

```rust
let final_state_root = machine.flush();
```

With the introduction of the FVM, this VM API is largerly preserved, although
implementations may opt to deviate from it.

### Technology

The proposed FVM execution runtime is [WebAssembly (Wasm)][Wasm/WebAssembly]
with 32-bit memories. 64-bit memories are still under development in the [Wasm
memory64][Wasm/memory64] extension.

Wasm with 32-bit memories supports 64-bit integer types and arithmetic, it just
can't address memory beyond 4GiB. This address space is deemed sufficient for
blockchain state transition use cases, but may be limiting for future and more
generalised applications of the FVM.

The FVM requires [Wasm multi-value support][Wasm/multi-value-support]. It
currently forbids [Wasm SIMD instructions][Wasm/SIMD-instructions], floating
number values and operations, and [Wasm threads][Wasm/Threads] to prevent
[Nondeterministic][Wasm/Nondeterminism] behavior. However, these constraints may
vary in the future.

### Responsibilities

The FVM applies messages to the state tree. It is not responsible for advancing
the chain itself. Concretely, it is mainly responsible for:

- Loading on-chain Wasm modules and compiling them to machine code.
- Performing preflight checks on the supplied messages.
- Instantiating the object stack described in the [core technical
  design](#core-technical-design) to apply messages.
- Routing calls across actors, via the Call Manager abstraction.
- Processing syscalls from actors, and delivering the results.
- Interfacing with the outer environment (Filecoin client) when necessary.
- Managing IPLD state read and write operations.

### Core technical design

This diagram serves as a reference for the technical design of the FVM.

![Technical design](../resources/fip-0030/technical-design.png)

#### Machine

The Machine is an instantiation of the FVM on a concrete epoch, over a specific
state root, ready to take in messages for execution as explained above.

#### Call Manager

The Call Manager coordinates the call stack involved in processing a given
message. This entails setting up and destroying Invocation Containers, tracking
gas usage, and halting execution when the gas limit is exceeded.

#### Invocation Container

The Invocation Container (IC) is the environment/sandbox that runs actor code
within the context of a single invocation. Reentrancy or recursion on the same
actor will spin off another IC.

The IC is an instance of a Wasm engine fulfilling the FVM-side of the contract.
The contract consists of:

1. Syscalls available as importable host-provided functions.
2. Shared types to represent data across the FVM boundary.
3. Actor-owned memory to exchange data in syscalls.
4. Transparent gas accounting and automatic execution halting.
5. (Future) Dynamic linkage of popular Wasm modules "blessed" by the community
   through some governance process, in order to reduce actor bytecode size (e.g.
   FVM SDKs, IPLD codecs, etc).

Because this contract may change over time, user-deployed actors may specify an
IC version at [`InitActor#InstallActor` time](#actor-deployment). The strategy
for deprecating IC versions over time has not been yet determined.

#### Syscalls

Syscalls are functions made available to the actor as Wasm imports, allowing it
to interact with the outer environment, and to call complex operations that are
more performant to execute in client land instead of Wasm (e.g. cryptographic
primitives).

#### Kernel

The Kernel is an object created by the Call Manager and injected into the
Invocation Container. It processes syscalls, and stores invocation-scoped state.

#### Externs

Similar to syscalls being functions provided to the actor by the FVM, Externs
are functions provided by the node to the FVM. Depending on the programming
languages at play, the Externs layer may be only logical (if both the client and
FVM are written in the same language), or may have a physical representation in
the form of an FFI boundary between languages.

### Actors

Actors are equivalent to smart contracts in other networks: they are pieces of
logic that live on-chain and can be triggered via messages.

#### Actor types

We distinguish three types of actors:

1. Built-in actors.
2. Native actors.
3. Foreign actors.

![Actor execution](../resources/fip-0030/actor-execution.png)

##### Built-in actors

Built-in actors are protocol-defined actor types. Up until now, these actors
shipped alongside the legacy VM and were tightly integrated with it. In the case
of Lotus (reference Filecoin client), these actors lived in
[filecoin-project/specs-actors][Repos/filecoin-project/specs-actors].

With the adoption of a universal, portable execution bytecode format, all
Filecoin clients can rely on a single codebase compiled to Wasm bytecode. This
speeds up protocol development, shortens protocol upgrade timelines, and reduces
coordination overhead.

This codebase sits at
[filecoin-project/builtin-actors][Repos/filecoin-project/builtin-actors], and
[FIP-0031][FIPs/FIP-0031] proposes its standardisation in the network through a
state migration.

This approach has a few practical implications:

1. The canonical actors become a common-good codebase for the Filecoin network,
   with core devs converging development effort around it.
2. Filecoin clients would embed the canonical Wasm bytecode into their binaries.
   The concrete mechanisms are implementation-dependent. The recommended
   approach is to embed the CAR bundle generated by the cited repo into the
   client's state blockstore.
3. Network upgrades would agree on the exact CodeCIDs of built-in actors to
   migrate to at the upgrade epoch.

##### Native user-defined actors

Native user-defined actors are actors written specifically for the FVM runtime.

Users can _technically_ write native user-defined actors in any programming
language that compiles to Wasm. However, language-specific overheads (e.g.
runtime, garbage collection, stdlibs, etc.) may lead to oversized Wasm bytecode
and execution overheads, translating to higher gas costs.

Furthermore, there will likely be hard limits enforced on the size of bytecode
deployables by the time support for user-deployed actors is introduced.

There's a [FVM Reference SDK][Repos/filecoin-project/ref-fvm/sdk] written in
Rust to accompany this FIP. As of today, it is used by the
[filecoin-project/builtin-actors][Repos/filecoin-project/builtin-actors]
codebase.

Generally speaking, we find that Rust is a reasonable choice to write native
user-defined actors due to the lack of a runtime, the ability to elide the
stdlib through `no_std`, and its mature Wasm support.

Exploration of other languages is something we encourage the community to
pursue. Concretely, we believe that AssemblyScript, Swift, Kotlin, and TinyGo
SDKs are worth exploring.

##### Foreign actors

Foreign actors are smart contracts or programs targeting non-FVM runtimes,
running inside the Filecoin network through emulation.

The ability to run foreign actors is useful for cross-chain interoperability,
and to extend Filecoin's reach and utility to other blockchains, allowing them
to access the network's storage capabilities more seamlessly.

The first kind of foreign actor we aim to support are **Ethereum smart
contracts**, through the deployment of EVM bytecode. This allows for
straightforward and relatively risk-free porting of existing battle-tested
Ethereum smart contracts to the Filecoin network.

Every foreign runtime is in turn an actor type, identified by a `CodeCID`.
Foreign runtimes are installed just like any other actor type. Foreign actors
instances are constructed through the `InitActor`, supplying the source
deployable as a constructor.

In the case of the EVM foreign runtime, we are looking to standardise on either
one of these interpreters:

1. [SputnikVM][Repos/rust-blockchain/evm], or
2. [bluealloy/revm][Repos/bluealloy/revm] (a fork of the above)

Every foreign runtime will need to specify bindings to map runtime-specific
aspects (e.g. addressing, crypto primitives, gas accounting, etc.) to Filecoin
counterparts. A preliminary [EVM <> FVM binding specification][FVM/EVM-FVM-binding-spec] exists.

Future foreign runtime candidates include Agoric SES, Solana eBPF, and others.
In all cases, compatibility should target the lowest level executable output in
its source form, rather than dealing with high-level languages using
alternative/custom toolchains. This reduces risk surface by increasing execution
fidelity/parity, and makes it possible to reuse developer tooling available in
the original ecosystem.

#### Actor bytecode representation

Wasm bytecode payloads will be represented as an IPLD DAG, and will be stored in
the state blockstore, owned by the node implementation.

**The concrete DAG layout, multihash function, and CID codec are yet to be
defined.**

Code will be linked to from the state tree through the existing `code` CID field
in the `ActorState` object:

```rust
pub struct ActorState {
    /// Link to code for the actor.
    pub code: Cid,
    /// Link to the state of the actor.
    pub state: Cid,
    /// Current sequential nonce of the actor.
    pub nonce: u64,
    /// Filecoin tokens available to the actor.
    pub balance: TokenAmount,
}
```

#### Actor deployment

The current `InitActor` (`f00`) will be extended with a (`InstallActor`) method
taking a single input parameter: the actor's Wasm bytecode. As mentioned above,
DAG representation format is to be defined. The actor's Wasm bytecode must
specify the version of the Invocation Container the bytecode requires, inside a
reserved exported global.

The state object of the `InitActor` will be extended with an `ActorRegistry`
HAMT of `CID => ActorSpec`, where `ActorSpec` is:

```rust
/// A simple actor specification/metadata structure, to be extended with
/// additional metadata in the future.
struct ActorSpec {
  /// The version of the invocation container.
  version: int, 
}
```

The logic of `InitActor#LoadActor` is as follows.

1. Validate the Wasm bytecode.
    - Perform syntax validation and structural validation, [as per standard](https://webassembly.github.io/spec/core/valid/index.html).
    - No floating point instructions.
2. Multihash the bytecode and calculate the code CID.
3. Check if the code CID is already registered in the `ActorRegistry`.
4. If yes, charge gas for the above operations and return the existing CID.
5. Insert an entry in the `ActorRegistry`, binding the bytecode CID with the
   actor spec.
6. Return the CID, and charge the cost of the above operations, and potentially
   a price for rent/storage.

At this point, the actor can be instantiated many times through the standard
`InitActor#Exec` method. Parameters provided will be passed through to the
actor's constructor (currently identified by `method_number=1`). This includes
byte streams corresponding to deployables for foreign actors (e.g. EVM
bytecode).

#### Actor message dispatch

With the exception of simple value transfers, messages trigger some actor logic
on the recipient actor. (In the future, value transfers may also trigger
arbitrary logic.)

Today, Filecoin chain messages carry a _method number_. The current VM matches
on recipient actor type and method number to dispatch to the appropriate
handler. This approach is **external method dispatch**.

With the FVM, actors now expose a **single entrypoint** in the form of a
Wasm-exported function, and conduct **internal method dispatch**.

The signature of an actor entrypoint is:

```rust
pub fn invoke(params_block_id: u32) -> u32 { }
```

- The single uint32 argument corresponds to the block ID of the encoded input
  parameters struct, or `0` for none.
- The single uint32 return value corresponds to the block ID of the return data
  struct, or `0` for none.

More information on block IDs can be found in [IPLD memory model](#ipld-memory-model)

This design decouples actors from their runtime, and is more aligned with the
actor model, where actors interact through inboxes. It also awards maximal
degrees of freedom and sophistication to support techniques such as structural
pattern matching, efficient pass-through proxying, interception, and more.

Because internal dispatch logic will rapidly become boilerplate, FVM SDKs should
offer dispatch sugar.

**Backwards compatibility**

The _method number_ field on messages remains unchanged to preserve backwards
compatibility. It may be deprecated and eventually removed later. Built-in
actors continue relying on _method number_, but now perform internal dispatch.

### Syscalls

This section specifies all the syscalls that the IC must make available to the
actor.

Currently, the FVM charges no gas for import linkage. In the future, the FVM may
charge a static or a dynamic cost for linking the concrete functions or
namespaces imported by the module.

**Interface type conventions**

- `off` and `len` in argument names refers to "memory offset" and "buffer
  length". Together, they define the bounds of a slice of memory.
- Syscall arguments prefixed with `o_` represent output parameters.
- The `Result` return type carries a **syscall error number** and the specified
  payload type. The latter only appears when the syscall succeeded (implied by
  error number `0`). These error numbers are ephemeral, and have no meaning
  beyond the FVM syscall boundary. Refer to the [FVM Error
  Conditions][FVM/Error-Conditions] document for more info.

### IPLD memory model

IPLD is the data model of Filecoin. Actors can be construed as logic that
receives an input IPLD graph, performs computation, and returns a new IPLD graph
(which is persisted by saving the root CID of the new graph in the actor's
state).

All state is stored and retrieved as IPLD. The state store lives on the node
side, and it is exposed to the FVM via an Extern. This is important as the VM
itself needs to understand the IPLD so we can do garbage collection, etc.

The FVM must guarantee that actors can only access data that is in their state
tree. This is done through the maintenance of an "accessible set" inside the
kernel.

Because Filecoin IPLD state objects are highly atomized and linked, accessing
and mutating entries in objects like HAMTs and AMT results in multiple
sequential state IO operations, each of which traverses the Extern boundary in a
non-parallelizable way. If the Extern is traversed through FFI, the cost of
operating on ADLs may be non-negligible.

**Block handles**

IPLD blocks are dynamically-sized blobs of data. When loading a block by CID,
the size is unknown, so the actor cannot allocate memory upfront. Moreover,
host-side memory is inaccessible to Wasm code, so it's not possible for the
Kernel to return a pointer to host-side memory for Wasm code to read.

For this reason, the low-level IPLD syscall API revolves around the concept of
"block handles". Block handles are references to blocks, inspired by Unix file
descriptors, and identified by a block ID (`u32`).

Parameters to actors and return data returned from actor calls are modelled as
IPLD blocks too. But since they are not referenced from state or elsewhere, they
aren't referenced by CID but merely by block IDs when invoking the Wasm actor
entrypoint (see [Actor message dispatch](#actor-message-dispatch)).

**Syscall mechanics**

- When accessing a block by CID through `ipld::block_open`, the Kernel returns a block
  ID, the size, and the codec.
- To read the block data, `ipld::block_read` takes a block ID and a pointer to a
  Wasm-side buffer.
- To write a block, `ipld::block_create` takes a buffer and a codec, and returns a
  block ID.
- If the Wasm actor needs to compute the CID for a block, it calls the
  `ipld::block_link` syscall passing in the block ID.
- An `ipld::block_stat` syscall is available to enquire the size and codec of the
  block by ID. This is useful to allocate a buffer for call parameters.

### Module caching

Wasm execution performance is a determining factor in the ability to maintain
blockchain epoch time (30 seconds).

We recommend implementations to compile Wasm bytecode into machine code for
faster execution, instead of relying on interpretation. This incurs in an
upfront CPU-bound compilation cost, in exchange for ongoing operating costs.

Actively or passively-managed module caching could be explored, but such
approaches may introduce vulnerabilities. Instead, we may factor in the
compilation compute cost and the perpetual storage cost, as deployment-time gas.

Any approach will need to account for eventual recompilation costs on events
like Wasm Engine or compiler upgrades.

### Gas charging

The current gas model relies on actor code being static and known ahead of time.
Gas is currently charged at the syscall level and not at the instruction level.

With the ability to run arbitrary code on the network, the gas model must
account for actual execution costs at the instruction level, in addition to
syscall-level charges.

An initial gas remodelling proposal is submitted in [FIP-0032][FIPs/FIP-0032].

### Specific actor coupling

Due to how certain parts of the Filecoin protocol work, implicit coupling that
exists between the VM and specific actor types will be carried over. Concretely:

- Account actor: the FVM must create new account actors when processing sends to
  pubkey addresses.
- Init actor: the FVM must load and query the init actor state when resolving
  addresses during message processing, and when the `actor::resolve_address` syscall is
  called. Additionally, a new init actor entry must be added when implicitly
  creating an account, as per above.
- Power actor and Storage Market actor: state is queried when handling the
  `network::total_fil_circ_supply` syscall.
- Burnt funds account and Reserve account: balances are queried when handling
  the `network::total_fil_circ_supply` syscall.

## Design Rationale

Concerning the choice of runtime, various technologies were evaluated, including
EVM, JavaScript/SES, LLVM IR, etc. Wasm was chosen for these reasons:

- It has a strong and promising future in the blockchain space; with room for
  cross-chain collaborations and interest groups
- It has a growing ecosystem of tooling and solutions (e.g. runtimes, package
  managers, language shims)
- It is portable across architectures and operating systems
- has deterministic execution as long as
  [non-deterministic][Wasm/Nondeterminism] features aren't used (of which we use
  none)
- It is usually compiled to machine code, but it can also be interpreted
- Bytecode specifies actual execution as opposed to high-level constructions or
  intermediate representations; this makes it suitable for stable
  content-addressing
- It is sandboxed and secure
- Allows for a choice of programming language for actors

## Backwards Compatibility

This FIP introduces a re-architecture of the execution layer, but it doesn't
propose a specific protocol change. Existing built-in actors will continue to
operate normally. Subsequent associated FIPs will explore the backwards
compatibility aspects of their respective protocol changesets (e.g. atomic
switch to the FVM, gas model changes).

## Test Cases

FVM implementations can subject themselves to the FVM-specific test vectors
hosted at: [filecoin-project/fvm-test-vectors][Repos/filecoin-project/fvm-test-vectors].

## Security Considerations

This specification entails a complete rearchitecture of the execution layer of
the Filecoin blockchain, and the transition to adopting a new actors codebase.
Such low-level and deep changes comes with non-negligible risks, the extent of
which will be analyzed as network upgrades with concrete scopes are proposed.

## Incentive Considerations

This specification FIP does not affect incentives in itself. However, the
ability to deploy arbitrary on-chain programs may impact chain utilization, gas
expenditures and burn, and the flow of tokens as a result of the use cases that
developers deploy on top of the FVM.

## Product Considerations

New product possibilities and horizons are brought to life by on-chain
user-programmability on the Filecoin network. As described in the Change
Motivation section, we expect the FVM to accelerate the pace of innovation in
the Filecoin network. Furthermore, as system functionality moves out to user
space, product requirements depending on protocol changes may be implemented
entirely in user space.

The FVM also creates new product requirements around developer tooling (e.g.
sandboxes, test kits, etc.) and testnets.

## Implementation

A reference implementation of the FVM is provided in the
[filecoin-project/ref-fvm][Repos/filecoin-project/ref-fvm] repository.
