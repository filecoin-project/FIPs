# FIP-0048: f4 Address Class

<!--You can leave these HTML comments in your merged FIP and delete the visible duplicate text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit it again. This is the suggested template for new FIPs. Note that a FIP number will be assigned by an editor. When opening a pull request to submit your FIP, please use an abbreviated title in the filename, `fip-draft_title_abbrev.md`. The title should be 44 characters or less.-->

## Simple Summary
<!--"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough." Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the FIP.-->

This FIP adds an extensible address class, `f4`, to support the creation of new user-defined actor addressing schemes. Specifically, the actor at `{some-actor-id}` (e.g., `123`) will manage all addresses starting with `f4{some-actor-id}f` (`f4123f`).

Additionally, this FIP adds the ability to send funds to such an address before deploying an actor there. As of today, it's possible to send funds to an account (`f1` or `f3`) that doesn't yet exist on-chain, but there's no way to send funds to a non-account actor (e.g., a multisig actor with an `f2` address) that doesn't yet exist on-chain.

This will allow users to:

- Implement foreign addressing systems (e.g., the one used in Ethereum) in Filecoin.
- Implement predictable addressing systems so that an actor's address may be computed _before_ deployment.
- Send funds to such a pre-computed actor address before actually deploying the actor there.

**NOTE:** While the `f4` address class is designed and intended to be managed by user-defined actors, this FIP currently restricts `f4` assignment to specific "blessed" address managers. This restriction will be relaxed in a future FIP once users are allowed to deploy native WebAssembly actors.

## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->

Currently, adding new address types and address derivation methods to the Filecoin network requires extensive changes and a network upgrade. This FIP introduces a new user-extensible address class such that new addressing systems can be added by _users_ without extensive changes and network upgrades.

It achieves this by adding a new address class (`f4`) where user-definable "address management" actors will be able to create new actors under an address-manager specific `f4` prefix (specifically, `f4{address-manager-actor-id}f`). This will allow Filecoin to support the native addressing schemes of foreign runtimes like the EVM and create new _predictable_ addressing scheme to support interactions (both actually and counterfactually) with addresses that do not yet exist on-chain.

Specifically, this FIP:

1. Creates a new extensible address class (`f4`) to support new addressing schemes.
2. Allows funds to be sent to an `f4` address before an actor has been deployed to the address.
3. Extends the `Init` actor with a new `Exec4` method for creating actors with specific `f4` addresses.
4. Extends `ActorState` objects to include the `f4` address, if assigned.
5. Adds a new `lookup_delegated_address` syscall to the FVM for looking up an actor's `f4` address, if assigned.

## Change Motivation
<!--The motivation is critical for FIPs that want to change the Filecoin protocol. It should clearly explain why the existing protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the FIP solves. FIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->

There are two primary motivations for this FIP:

1. While Filecoin _currently_ allows users to interact with and/or predict the addresses of _account_ actors (f1 and f3) that do not yet exist on-chain, it _doesn't_ currently allow users to interact with and/or predict the addresses of _non-account_ actors (f2) before deployment. This FIP supersedes [Predictable actor address generation for wallet contracts, state channels (aka CREATE2)](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/379).
    - This functionality is important for custom wallet types where a user may want to generate a wallet's address _before_ deploying the wallet (e.g., because the wallet may never actually receive funds).
    - This functionality is _especially_ important for state-channel applications where a state-channel may need to be able to refer to actors that, in the "optimistic" case, will never actually be deployed on-chain.
2. The FVM aims to be a hypervisor with first-class support for runtimes like the EVM but to achieve full compatibility, the FVM must support the addressing schemes used by said runtimes (e.g., Ethereum addressing) as said runtimes often rely on particular address formats and derivation logic.
    - EVM tooling expects Ethereum addresses.
    - Tools that interact with EVM actors counterfactually expect the addresses of said actors to be derived via the precise method specified in the CREATE2 opcode.
    - Tools like, e.g., Metamask will derive Ethereum addresses for wallets, not Filecoin addresses, and converting between the two is impossible due to the hash functions involved.

This FIP achieves this by:

1. Providing a way to create new "predictable" addressing schemes that will allow users to pre-compute the address at which some actor _could_ be deployed on-chain, without forcing them to actually deploy it (yet).
2. More generally, allowing users to deploy _arbitrary_ user-defined addressing schemes.

## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current Filecoin implementations. -->

This FIP adds a new extensible address class (`f4`) where user-defined address management actors will be able to create new actors and assign them `f4` addresses starting with the address manager's actor ID.

For now, this FIP proposes that address management actors be limited to built-in "singleton" actors, but expect users to be able to deploy their own address management actors in the future.

There are four key changes proposed in this design:

1. A new address class (`f4`). Tooling will need to be adapted to parse and handle said addresses.
2. A new `lookup_delegated_address` syscall to retrieve an actor's `f4` address and a new `delegated_address` field in the `ActorState` object to record an actor's `f4` address.
3. A new "placeholder" actor.
4. A new `Exec4` method on the init actor to support the `f4` address class.

**NOTE**: For now, f4 addresses may only be assigned by and in association with specific "blessed" address managers, the first of these will likely be the "Ethereum Address Manager (EAM)". Once users are able to deploy custom WebAssembly actors, this restriction should be relaxed (in a future FIP).

**Parameters**

| Parameter              | Value | Rationale                     |
|------------------------|-------|-------------------------------|
| `MAX_SUBADDRESS_BYTES` | 54    | fits in 64 bytes when encoded |

### The f4 Address Class

An address manager will own `f4` addresses (in the binary representation) starting with the leb128-encoded actor ID and followed by an arbitrary (chosen by the address management actor, up to `MAX_SUBADDRESS_BYTES` bytes) sub-address: `[0x4 (f4 address class)] || {leb128(actor-id)} || {sub-address}`.

In text, this address will be formatted as `f4{decimal(actor-id)}f{base32(sub-address || checksum)}` where `checksum` is the blake2b-32 (32bit/4byte blake2b) hash of the address in its binary representation (protocol included). This is the same checksumming approach used in the textual representation of f1-f3 addresses.

For example, an address management actor at `f010` will be able to assign addresses starting with `f410-` in text or `[4, 10, ...]` in binary. [^1]

**NOTE**: The textual format defined here is the *universal* textual format for `f4` addresses. We expect that chain explorers and client implementations will understand specific well-known address types and will format these addresses according to their "native" representation. For example, tooling should transparently convert Ethereum addresses in the `0x...` to and from the equivalent `f4` address. [^2]

### New `lookup_delegated_address` Syscall And State Changes

To support foreign address systems, the FVM must provide a way to lookup an actor's `f4` address. This FIP proposes two changes to support this functionality:

1. A new field in the actor state-root object to store an actor's `f4` address, if assigned.
2. A new syscall to retrieve this information.

The `ActorState` object currently has the following fields (encoded as a CBOR list):

 ```rust
pub struct ActorState {
    pub code: Cid,
    pub state: Cid,
    pub nonce: u64,
    pub balance: TokenAmount,
}
```

This FIP adds a fifth field, `delegated_address`:

 ```rust
pub struct ActorState {
    pub code: Cid,
    pub state: Cid,
    pub nonce: u64,
    pub balance: TokenAmount,
    pub delegated_address: Option<Address>, // NEW!
}
```

If an actor doesn't have an `f4` address, this field will be a CBOR `null`. Otherwise, it will contain the actor's `f4` address.

This FIP also proposes a new `lookup_delegated_address` syscall to retrieve this information:

```rust
mod actor {
    /// Looks up the "delegated" (f4) address of the target actor (if any).
    ///
    /// # Arguments
    ///
    /// `addr_buf_off` and `addr_buf_len` specify the location and length of the output buffer in
    /// which to store the address.
    ///
    /// # Returns
    ///
    /// The length of the address written to the output buffer, or 0 if the target actor has no
    /// delegated (f4) address.
    ///
    /// # Errors
    ///
    /// | Error           | Reason                                                           |
    /// |-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
    /// | NotFound        | if the target actor does not exist                               |
    /// | BufferTooSmall  | if the output buffer isn't large enough to fit the address       |
    /// | IllegalArgument | if the output buffer isn't valid, in memory, etc.                |
    pub fn lookup_delegated_address(
        actor_id: u64,
        addr_buf_off: *mut u8,
        addr_buf_len: u32,
    ) -> Result<u32>;
}
```

### Placeholder Actors

To support interactions with addresses that do not yet exist on-chain, the FVM must support sending funds to an address before an actor is deployed there. It's already possible to automatically create an account (f1 or f3) on send, but it's not possible to do the same for arbitrary actors.

First, we'll define a special "placeholder" actor that does nothing. The placeholder's implementation is simply:

```rust
#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn invoke(_: u32) -> u32 {
    0
}
```

On `send` to an unassigned `f4` address `f4{actor-id}f{subaddress}`, the FVM will:

1. Validate that an actor with ID `actor-id` exists. For now, the `actor-id` will be further restricted to "blessed" address managers.
2.  Create a new "placeholder actor" to hold the received funds, assigning the `f4` address to that new actor and recording the new actor's `f4` address in the actor's `ActorState` object.

Sending to an unassigned `f2` address will not be supported as `f2` addresses are designed to protect against reorgs and aren't designed to for this use-case (see [`f2` versus `f4`](#f2-versus-f4)).

Specifically, the FVM will:

1. Create a new "placeholder" actor with the appropriate code CID, an empty state, zero nonce, and the target `f4` address.
2. Invoke the requested method on the placeholder (which always does nothing), depositing any value transferred.
3. Assign the target `f4` address to that actor (but don't yet assign an `f2` address) by updating the `Init` actor's address map.

The placeholder actor will have the following state object serialized as a DagCBOR tuple:

 ```rust
 ActorState {
     code: PLACEHOLDER_CODE_CID,
     state: EMPTY_ARRAY_CID,
     nonce: 0,
     balance: TokenAmount::zero(),
     delegated_address: f4_address
}
```

### Exec4

To support the `f4` address class, this FIP adds an `Exec4` method to the `Init` actor to create new actors with an `f4` address (in addition to an `f2` address) under the *caller's* `f4` sub-namespace. The `f4` to actor-id to address mappings are stored alongside the `f1-f3` to actor-id address mappings in the `Init` actor's `address_map` requiring no additional state or state migrations.

Specifically, given the parameters:

```rust
struct Exec4Params {
    subaddress: Bytes, // limited to MAX_SUBADDRESS_BYTES
    code: Cid,
    constructor_params: Bytes,
}
```

`Exec4` will:

1. Compute the `f4` address as `4{leb128(caller-actor-id)}{subaddress}` where `{caller-actor-id}` is the actor ID of the actor invoking the init actor and `{subaddress}` is the sub-address specified in the `Exec4` parameters.
2. If an actor exists at that address and it is not a placeholder, abort.
3. If an actor does not exist at that address, create a new actor (with a new actor ID) and assign the `f4` address to that actor.
4. Assign an `f2` (stable) address to the actor (the `f4` address may not be reorg stable).
5. Set the actor's code CID to `code` and invoke the actor's constructor.
6. Finally, `Exec4` will return the actor's ID and `f2` (stable) address. It will not return the `f4` address as the caller should be able to compute that locally.

**NOTE**: For now, `Exec4` will only be callable by "blessed" address managers.

## Design Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->

This FIP meets the design goals by:

- Supporting interactions with addresses that do not yet exist on-chain by allowing user-defined address management actors to assign addresses based on arbitrary properties.
- Supporting arbitrary addressing schemes (e.g., Ethereum addressing) by carving out address "namespaces".

In this section, we discuss some of the tradeoffs and alternatives considered.

### Init Actor State

As this FIP stores `f4` addresses alongside `f2` addresses in the same map, actors with f4 addresses will have _two_ entries in this map. We could, alternatively, put these addresses in a separate map but the current FIP lets us avoid changing the Init actor's state layout (for now).

### Hashing v. Prefixing

An alternative to prefixing (`f4{actor-id}f{subaddress}`) would be to define a namespace via a hash function. I.e., an actor would own `f4{hash(actor-id || subaddress)}`.

The primary benefit of this approach is that addresses have a predictable size. The primary *downside* is that:

- This is *slightly* more expensive to compute and EVM actors will have to convert Ethereum addresses into `f4` addresses on-chain.
- It's not reversible. This makes tooling and debugging significantly more painful.

### Control Inversion

An alternative to the factory approach would be to invert the flow and:

1. Have the "creating" actor call `Exec4` on the init actor with the address of the address manager.
2. Have the init actor call some `GenerateAddress` method on the address manager.

However, the current approach gives the address manager more control as it effectively gets to act as a user-defined "init" actor, sitting between the user and the real init actor.

<details>
<summary>Aside explaining why we even considered this approach...</summary>

Currently (and unchanged by this proposal), new actors are constructed by the init actor as follows:

1. The init actor creates a new actor object, assigns it a new ID, and hooks it into the state-tree.
2. The init actor then calls method 1 on this new actor to "construct" it.

This means that an actor's constructor will always see the init actor as the "sender" and has no real way to know the "ultimate" actor that created it.

However, there have been discussions about replacing method 1 with a new top-level WebAssembly function, replacing step 2 above with a special privileged syscall to construct an actor. This would:

1. Make the "creating" actor (not the init actor) appear as the sender inside the constructor.
2. Ensure that actors can't be confused as to whether they're being invoked (via a message) or constructed.

Unfortunately, the actor factory approach proposed in this FIP means that the address manager would appear as the "sender", not the ultimate "creating" actor. On the other hand, we were unable to find any strong arguments for this being an issue in practice.

</details>

### Bind4

The original proposal included a `Bind4` method on the `Init` actor to bind an `f4` address to an _existing_ actor (allowing actors to have more than one `f4` address). This would have allowed one to, for example:

1. Receive funds at some `f1` address (A) (e.g., from some existing Filecoin user).
2. Receive funds at the equivalent Ethereum `f4` address (B) (e.g., from some existing Metamask user).
3. Later deploy a Filecoin account to A, then `Bind4` B to said account, merging them into a single account.

Unfortunately, by step 3, both accounts would have been assigned separate `f0` addresses. Merging these accounts would have required either removing or re-assigning one of the `f0` addresses which would have violated existing assumptions on how ID addresses behave.

### Textual Format

The *universal* textual format of f4 addresses, `f4{decimal(actor-id)}f{base32(sub-address || checksum)}`, is a trade-off between verbosity, readability, and determinism.

- We split the actor-assigned "sub-address" with an `f` to make it possible to "read" the address management actor's ID without having to decode the address.
    - We could have encoded this address as `f4{base32(leb-encoded-actor-id || sub-address || checksum)}`, but that would have been impossible for a human to read.
    - We considered splitting the address with a dash (`f4123-abcde`), but @jbenet pointed out that dashes in identifiers have poor UX: they don't select as one word on double-click.
- We chose to encode the actor-id as a decimal to mirror `f0`.
- We chose to `base32` encode the sub-address because it may be long. The main downside is that converting to/from an Ethereum address may require re-encoding from hex to base32 (but this point is somewhat moot given the checksum anyways).
- We chose to require a specific checksum format and to not support multiple bases (e.g., multibase) in this address format to ensure that two `f4` addresses are equivalent if and only if they have the same textual representation. This unfortunately means that converting to and from external addressing schemes like Ethereum/EVM addresses cannot be done by hand.

### F2 Versus F4

This FIP makes a few interesting decisions with respect to `f2` addresses:

1. While it allows sending to unassigned `f4` addresses, it does not allow the same for `f2` addresses.
2. It assigns _both_ an `f2` and an `f4` address to new actors.
4. It does not assign an `f2` address until the actor actually _exists_ on-chain.

The key distinction is that `f2` addresses are designed to stable and that `f4` addresses are designed to be "user-programmable".

- An `f2` address allows a user to create a chain of messages where a later message refers to an actor created in an earlier message. An `f2` address refers to _the_ actor created by a _specific_ message.
- An `f4` address allows an actor (an address manager) to "control" an address-space. This allows the address manager to implement foreign addressing schemes (e.g., Ethereum's) and allows users to refer to addresses that _could_ contain an actor with a set of properties enforced by an address manager.

Circling back to the design decisions:

1. A send to an unassigned `f2` address must fail because that means a prior message in a message chain failed for some reason and didn't create the expected actor. If the send were to succeed and create a placeholder (as happens with an unassigned `f4` address) the funds would be lost forever.
2. Assigning an `f2` address along with an `f4` address allows a message chain to safely refer to an actor deployed in a prior message even if a prior message in the chain _fails_ because, e.g., someone else successfully deployed an actor at the target `f4` address.
3. We delay assigning an `f2` address until an actor is deployed for the same reason.

### Accepting/Rejecting Non-Zero Messages in the Placeholder Actor

The placeholder actor accepts all messages on all method numbers. This behavior matches the behavior of, e.g. Ethereum accounts.

We considered rejecting everything but simple value transfers (method 0) due to some concerns around re-orgs. For example:

1. User U1 sends a message to create some actor with an f4 address A.
2. Some user U2 transfers value to A with `Deposite(some_address)` method, attempting to deposit funds into an account identified by `some_address`.
3. A chain re-org happens and the message from U2 gets executed before the message from U1.

Rejecting all non-zero methods would prevent this issue.

However, the primary purpose of a placeholder is to be a place to store value _before_ an actor is actually deployed. Rejecting method invocations would, e.g., prevent placeholders from receiving NFTs the FRC-0053 universal receiver hook, receiving value from EVM calls, etc.

### Recording F4 addresses in the ActorState root

Instead of recording `f4` addresses in each actor's state-root, one _could_ record this address in the actor's state itself (i.e., implement this in "userland"). However, this approach has some significant downsides:

First, the actor needs to somehow _learn_ about its address, which means the address would likely need to be passed into the actor in the constructor parameters. If the address is derived _from_ the constructor parameters, the actor may need to be constructed in multiple steps.

Second, learning an actor's `f4` address would involve:

1. Calling some well-known method to lookup the `f4` address.
2. Resolving that address back into an actor ID to make sure it actually belongs to the actor in question.

### Recording _other_ addresses in the ActorState root

A previous proposal suggested storing the `f1` and `f3` addresses in the actor state root object as well. Effectively, the `delegated_address` field would simply be an `address` field. However:

1. In many ways, the `f4` address class supersedes the `f1` and `f3` address classes. By only recording `f4` addresses in this field, we leave room to eventually deprecate `f1` and `f3` addresses (assigning `f4` addresses to all actors, even [existing accounts][f4-4-all]). This also aligns well with the push towards [account abstraction][account-abstraction], because user-programmed accounts would likely have `f4` addresses (and couldn't have `f1` or `f3` addresses).
2. There's no easy-to-explain reason group `f1`, `f3`, and `f4` addresses into a common "class" while leaving out `f2`. The real answer is that these (`f1`, `f3`, and `f4`) are are _useful_ to know on-chain, while `f2` addresses generally are not, but that doesn't make the situation any less confusing.

## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All FIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The FIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. FIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility treatise may be rejected outright.-->

While this FIP aims to minimize backwards incompatible changes, it will require a state migration and will introduce new features and behavior changes:

- A new `delegated_address` field will be added to all actor state-root objects. For all existing actors, this will be a single byte per actor to represent a CBOR null. To support this, the state-tree version will be bumped to version 5.
- The address map in the init actor may now map multiple addresses to the same actor. Clients (especially dashboards) that aggregate/parse chain state will need to handle this case.
- The code CID of a deployed actor may now change from the "placeholder" code CID to an actual code CID. Implementations that cache code CIDs will need to handle this case.
- This FIP introduces a new address class (`f4`). Implementations of the Filecoin addressing standard will need to handle parsing of this new address class.

## Test Cases
<!--Test cases for an implementation are mandatory for FIPs that are affecting consensus changes. Other FIPs can choose to include links to test cases if applicable.-->

### Address Format

TODO: ...

### Behavior

TODO: Test vectors will be extracted from the reference implementation once completed.

## Security Considerations
<!--All FIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design decisions, concerns, important discussions, implementation-specific guidance and pitfalls, an outline of threats and risks and how they are being addressed. FIP submissions missing the "Security Considerations" section will be rejected. A FIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Security Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->

### Address Stability

Unlike `f1-f3` addresses, `f4` addresses may not be stable across reorgs (depending on the address management actor). This could be used to confuse users who may be conditioned to assume "short addresses are unstable, long addresses are 'secure'".

The only real solution here is to educate users that "`f4` means user defined".

## Incentive Considerations
<!--All FIPs must contain a section that discusses the incentive implications/considerations relative to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for incentive discussion. A discussion on how the proposed change will incentivize reliable and useful storage is required. FIP submissions missing the "Incentive Considerations" section will be rejected. An FIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Incentive Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->

### Actor Churn

By relying on ID addresses to distinguish between different `f4` address sub-namespaces, this FIP may encourage ID address "churn" by those seeking "vanity" addresses.

However, we have mitigated one aspect of this: `f4` addresses may not be used to _reward_ ID address churn  by deploying to an `f4` address managed by a non-existent address management actor.

## Product Considerations
<!--All FIPs must contain a section that discusses the product implications/considerations relative to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for product discussion. A discussion on how the proposed change will enable better storage-related goods and services to be developed on Filecoin. FIP submissions missing the "Product Considerations" section will be rejected. An FIP cannot proceed to status "Final" without a Product Considerations discussion deemed sufficient by the reviewers.-->

There are two main product goals in this FIP:

1. Support Ethereum tooling and the EVM. This will allow users to deploy user-defined actors on the Filecoin network without having to create an entirely new ecosystem, tooling, etc.
2. Support interactions with addresses that do not yet exist on-chain (required for many counterfactual interactions).

### Ethereum Support

In a future FIP, we will propose a Ethereum Address Manager (EAM) actor, likely at the address `f032`. This actor will be responsible for assigning all "Ethereum-style" addresses on the Filecoin network (EVM actor addresses and Ethereum account addresses).

#### Ethereum Addresses

With this FIP, the full Ethereum address would be preserved inside the `f432f` address sub-namespace making it easy to:

1. Recognize Ethereum addresses (likely displaying them in their usual `0x...` format).
2. Convert back and forth between the Ethereum address format (`0x...`) and the Filecoin (`f4...`) format.

#### CREATE

To support `CREATE1`, the  EAM will export a `Create` method taking:

```rust
struct CreateParams {
    initcode: Bytes,
}
```

It will then create an address per the Ethereum yellowpaper and call `Init.Exec4` with:

```rust
Exec4Params {
    address: b"<computed address>",
    code: EVM_ACTOR_CID,
    params: initcode,
}
```

#### CREATE2

To support `CREATE2`, the  EAM will export a `Create2` method taking:

```rust
struct Create2Params {
    initcode: Bytes,
    salt: [u8; 32],
}
```

It will then create an address per [EIP-1014](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1014) and call `Init.Exec4` with:

```rust
Exec4Params {
    address: b"<computed address>",
    code: EVM_ACTOR_CID,
    params: initcode,
}
```

#### Abstract Accounts

This highly depends on how code will be deployed to an [abstract account](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/discussions/388). It will likely involve a `CreateAccount` method on the ETH Address Manager, and will also likely involve the ability to automatically deploy an abstract account to a placeholder actor in some cases.

### Interactions With Unassigned Addresses

`f4` addresses support interactions addresses that do not yet exist on-chain by delegating address assignment (within some `f4` prefix) to a (potentially user-defined) address management actor. These interactions may be _actual_ (a user may send to an address that has not yet been defined) or counterfactual (a user may specify such an address in a payment channel voucher, but never actually _create_ an actor at said address).

For example, let's say we needed to be able to refer to an actor that *could* exist with some specific code CID and some specific constructor parameters (effectively, `CREATE2`).

To achieve this, we'd deploy an address manager actor with a single `Exec(code_cid, constructor_params)` method (i.e., identical to `Init.Exec`). Internally, this function would call `Init.Exec4(subaddress=hash(code_cid || constructor_params, code=code_cid, params=constructor_params).` In practice, this actor will likely already exist on-chain from day one.

With this address manager actor, we can refer to an actor that *might* exist constructed with some `code` and `params` as `f4{decimal(address-management-actor)}{hash(code || params)}`.

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any core FIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the FIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
