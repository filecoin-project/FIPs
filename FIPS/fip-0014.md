## Simple Summary
Allow the life cycle of V1 proof sectors to be able to extend.
Allow the V1 proof sectors life cycle extention. 

## Abstract
All the V1 proof sectors are sealed with collaterals and gas fees, but they have not received the same treatment as other sectors. The security issue of V1 proof sectors are not enough to threaten the chain security. So this proposal allows the V1 proof sectors lifecycle to be extended. 

## Change Motivation
In the case of network security, the fairness of the decentralized network needs to be guaranteed. Miners with V1 proof sectors have also gone through the strict sealing process, and have paid the collaterals and gas. The V1 proof sectors lifecycle should be allowed to extended without affecting the chain security. 
Although the V1 sectors have some security vulnerabilities, these security factors are not enough to constitute a reason for not allowing extensions. This is not a vulnerability that threatens the security of the chain, so extension should be allowed. 

### Actor changes
var ExtensibleProofTypesV7 = map[abi.RegisteredSealProof]struct{}{ 
        abi.RegisteredSealProof_StackedDrg32GiBV1:   {}, 
        abi.RegisteredSealProof_StackedDrg64GiBV1:   {}, 
        abi.RegisteredSealProof_StackedDrg32GiBV1_1: {}, 
        abi.RegisteredSealProof_StackedDrg64GiBV1_1: {}, 
}
