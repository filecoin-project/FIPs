## Simple Summary

A one-message protocol for updating any sector with new data without re-sealing.

## Abstract

Storage provider embeds deal data into existing sector replica with some unpredictable randomness by "xor"-ing.

The miner generates one message which proves that sector was updated with new data.

## Change Motivation

Since 90+% of sectors in the Filecoin Network are CC sectors, having a protocol that allows for updating CC sectors to store real data without incurring in a full re-sealing would massively improve our network in terms of the amount of real data stored through it. 

1. It would allow **decoupling sealing latency from deal-making speed** - offering storage clients an improved experience for how quickly their data can land in on-chain deals
2. It would **unlock the 8EiB of storage already committed to the Filecoin network** to be quickly used for deals - enabling a 100PiB+ client to make deals for their entire dataset with a single miner like [f0127595](https://filfox.info/en/address/f0127595) which already has 120PiB of committed capacity.
3. It makes **utilizing existing committed capacity much cheaper for miners** (since theyâ€™ve already invested the sealing cost), increasing the chances they pay clients to add FIL+ data to these sectors.

What this FIP does not support (see Future Work section):
* Deal updates or updating sectors with existing deals
* Moving deals across sectors


## Specification

### Nomenclature
**SectorKeyCID** - on-chain commitment of CC sector replica

**UnsealedSectorCID** - commitment of deal data generated from PieceCIDs

**SealedSectorCID** - commitment of sector replica with deals embedded in it

**EncodingRands** - collection of **HashShards** randomness values used for encoding process

**Poseidon-128** - SNARK friendly hash function


### Parameters

**ChallengesNumber** = 1376 - number of challenges to be proven

**HashShards** = 512 - number of hashes used for randomness in encoding process


### One-messages Update Protocol
1. **Storage Provider accepts and publishes storage deals (using `PublishStorageDeals`)**
2. **If necessary storage provider extends sector expiration so that sector is active long enough to contain deals with `miner.ExtendSectorExpiration`**
3. **Storage Provider updates an existing replica with deals**:
	1. Pre-generate HashShards possible number of `EncodingRand(ComputeUnsealedCID(P1, P2, P3, ...), i)`
	where `P1, P2, P3, ...` are pieces corresponding to deals that will included in this sector.
	2. Encode the deal data into existing replica using `newReplica[i] = Enc(sectorKey[i], data[i], EncodingRand(o))` function:
		- `newReplica` is the vector of `Fr` elements of the new replica
		- `sectorKey` is the vector of `Fr` elements of the CC sector replica data
		- `data` is the vector of `Fr` elements of the deals data ordered and padded as done in the sealing subroutine
		- `NodeSectorSize` is size of the sector in nodes (32 byte chunks)
	3. Compute SealedSectorCID of the `newReplica`.
4. **Storage Provider produces a proof of sector update.**
	Generate a SNARK that proves:
	1. Generation of ChallengesNumber challenges in batches of 8:
		1. For `j=0..ChallengesNumber//8`, `[_, c[8*j+7], c[8*j+6], ..., , c[8*j] = Split-31bit(Poseidon-128(Poseidon-128(UnsealedSectorCID, SealedSectorCID), j)`.
		The `Split-31bit` splits the 255bit output of Poseidon-128 hash into 8 31 bit chunks and discards 7 high bits.
		2. `c[i] = c[i] mod NodeSectorSize`
	2. For each challenge `i=0..ChallengesNumber`,  `c = c[i]`
		1. Encoding: the following we correcty computed: `newReplica[c] = Enc(sectorKey[c], data[c], Poseidon-128(UnsealedSectorCID, c*HashNumber//NodeSectorSize)`
		2. Inclusion proofs:
			1. `newReplica[c]` is the opening of `UpdatingSectorCID` at position `c`
			2. `sectorKey[c]` is the opening of `CommRLast` from `SealedSectorCID` at position `c`
			3. `data[c]` is the opening of `UnsealedSectorCID` at position `c`
5. **Storage Provider publishes `Miner.ReplicaUpdate(SectorID, NewSealedSectorCID, deals []DealID, Proof)`**:
   	1. Validate input parameters
	2. Activate Deals
	3. Generate `NewUnsealedSectorCID` (CommD) based on DealIDs and market actor state
	4. Verify the proof of correct data update:
		- Verify that `proof` is valid for using inputs: `NewSealedSectorCID`, `NewUnsealedSectorCID`, `SectorKey`.
	5. Update SectorInfo

### Algorithms


#### Encoding Randomness

`EncodingRand(UnsealedSectorCID, i) = Poseidon-128(UnsealedSectorCID, i*HashShards//NodeSectorSize)`

Intuitively the sector nodes (32byte chunks) are split into **HashShards** number of continuous segments with
the same encoding randomness.

#### Encoding

The current encoding algorithm is the following:

`Enc(sectorKey[i], data[i]) = sectorKey[i] + data[i] * EncodingRand(i)`

The Encoding function is cheap and allows for parallel encoding. 

#### Decoding

`Dec(sectorKey[i], replica[i]) = (replica[i] - sectorKey[i]) * (EncodingRand(i)<sup>-1</sup>)`

The modular inverse of `EncodingRand` can be computed only **HashShards** times per whole operation.

### Retrieving updated data from encoded replica

1. From the `replica`:
   2. Regenerate `sectorKey` by re-sealing the sector
   3. For each `i`: `Dec(sectorKey[i], replica[i], EncodingRand)`

### Deprecation of current CC Upgrade

`PreCommitSector` will no longer be allowed to schedule current cc upgrades during prove commit.  The data on chain tracking cc upgrades and the miner actor logic doing current cc upgrades will be removed. PreCommit message parameters will no longer include fields for specifying cc upgrades.

### ProveReplicaUpdate Actor Method

#### Params
```
type SnapDealsUpdate struct {
     SectorID SectorID
     Deadline int
     Partition int
     Deals []DealID
     Proof ReplicaUpdateProofs
}
```
`Miner.ProveReplicaUpdates(Updates []SnapDealsUpdate)

#### Spec
Unless stated assume that each step operates on all inputs updates in a loop

1. **Param validation**
   1. Assert that `SectorID` was originally CC sector
   2. Assert that `SectorID` has no deals active
   3. Assert proof size is not above limits
   4. Assert batch size bounds are not above limits
   5. Assert that sector's power is active. Fail if sector is in unproven, faulty or terminated states
2. **Market Activation and CommD generation**
   1. Call `market.ActivateDeals` on all deals in the update
   2. Call `market.ComputeDataCommittment` with batched inputs to generate all CommDs for all updates
3. **Proof verification**
   1. Extend runtime with VerifyReplicaUpdate method
4. **Update Miner State**
   1. `SectorNumber` i.e. the sector ID, `Expiration` and `SealProof` fields remain unchanged
   2. `SealedCID`, `DealIDs`, `DealWeight`, `VerifiedDealWeight` are all modified to match the upgraded sector with deals
   3. `InitialPledge` is the max of CC sector's InitialPledge and the value computed with the upgrade power at the upgrade epoch
   4. `ReplacedDayReward` is assigned the value of `ExpectedDayReward` and `ExpectedDayReward` is recalculated, as in current CC upgrade
   5. `ReplacedSectorAge` is set to `upgradeEpoch - Activation` as in current CC upgrade
   6. `ExpectedStoragePledge` is recalculated
   7. If `SectorKeyCID` is null, set it to `SealedCID` of the CC sector being replaced
   8. `Activation` is set to current epoch 
   9. Call `ReplaceSectors` on all partitions with updates
5. **Update Power**
   1. `partition.ReplaceSectors` will update miner deadline state to correct power
   2. Call `power.UpdateClaimedPower` to update power actor state.

#### Batching and Error Handling

This method accepts a batch of updates to be processed in one message call.  As much as possible error handling should ignore updates that do not pass validation and only fail if all updates fail validation or if the entire operation fails.

### Upgrade and State Migration
1. Migration removing precommit info about cc upgrades in the PreCommit map
2. PreCommit params will lose the fours cc upgrade fields
3. Add `SectorKey` a new field to the sector info.  It should be a pointer to a cid serializing to cbor null when no snap deals upgrade has occurred and becoming the original `SealedCID` after the first snap deals update

## Design Rationale

### Encoding Function

The aim of the encoding function is to allow encoding data into an existing sector key without breaking
the compressibility assumption of PoRep.
...

### Parameters choice

* `ChallengeNumber`: 1376 - to facilitate required security factor with Fiat-Shamir (TODO expand in Security Considerations).
* `HashShards`: 512 - to reach required spacegap fraction without neadlessly increasing the cost of conducting protocol (TODO explanation).

### Limitations

The update protocol is limited to CC sectors as the `SectorKey` commitment is only avaliable for sectors with no data. The SectorKey commitment is currently included as `CommRLast` commitment inside the on-chain `SealedSectorCID`  when the sector is CC. When the sector contains deals natively the `SealedSectorCID` includes only `CommRLast+Data` commitment.

## Backwards Compatibility

This change is not backwards compatible and will require a new actors version and a network upgrade.

## Test Cases

TODO

## Security Considerations

### Loosing epsilon-Replication guarantees

This changes changes the security property of Filecoin. Retrievability of the files and space-hardness are still guaranteed. TODO: expand on this.

### Poseidon-128

Poseidon-128 is zk-SNARK friendly hash function which is already widely used in Filecoin protocol.
Both uses of Poseidon-128 include Domain Separation Tags such that the usage here does not clash with possible future use cases.

Domain Separation Tags used:
 - Encoding Randomness Generation: `XXXX`
 - Challenge Generation: `XXXX`

## Incentive Considerations

SnapDeals does not allow storage providers to release currently held collateral for the sector but it allows
to reuse that already held collateral if collateral required is greater, for example due to verified deal.

## Product Considerations

Snap Deals protocol significantly reduces the time needed for data to be included in a sector
and confirmed on-chian. The process was designed with cost for storage providers in mind.

## Implementation

## Future work

* DeclareDeals to support deal transfer: allow moving deals from sector to sector
* CapacityDeals: allow purchasing a capacity of the storage of a storage provider instead of the storage of a specific deal
* Update protocol that does not require to perform an operation on a full sector.
* DealUpdates: a license to terminate a deal in place for a new one (e.g. a user wants to update a portion of their files)
