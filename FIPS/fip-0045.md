## Simple Summary
Represents Filecoin Plus data cap allocations separately from the built-in market actor.
Adds explicit term (duration) limits to data cap allocations.
Simplifies the quality-adjusted power calculation to remove spreading out over a sector's lifetime.
Supports extending the terms of data cap allocations independently of market deals.
Represents un-allocated data cap as a fungible token.
These changes provide a foundation for user-programmed market actors to broker Filecoin Plus verified deals in the future.

## Abstract
The current implementation of Filecoin Plus verified deals is deeply coupled to the built-in market actor,
which is treated as trusted code.
The built-in market is inefficient, limited in functionality and can only improve very slowly through network upgrades.
The architectural coupling prevents any user-programmed actors from replicating, improving, or varying deal-related functionality,
especially with any relation to Filecoin Plus.

This proposal decouples the representation of Filecoin Plus data cap allocations from the built-in market actor's deals, 
and the process of claiming it from the built-in market's processes.
The built-in market actor remains a delegate, acting on behalf of verified clients,
but only in a way that will be accessible to user-programmed market actors too.
This removes some of the necessary trust vested in the built-in market actor's code. 

Along the way, this proposal implements the ability to extend data cap terms beyond the market's deal terms.
It also simplifies the quality adjusted power calculation so as to support
the future ability to update the data in a sector regardless of its previous content.
This proposal gets half way toward full support for user-programmed market actors.

## Change Motivation
The core motivation behind this proposal is to enable the development of markets and market-like actors
on the FVM, once user-programability is supported.
All negotiation between data clients and storage providers is currently limited by 
the built-in market actor's limited abilities,
and improvements to it are thus limited to FIPs and network upgrades.
Features like deal extension, multi-sector deals, re-negotiation, deal transfer, capacity deals,
auction markets, repair markets, insurance, derivatives etc. should all be possible in user-programmed actors.
None should require a network-wide upgrade to realise.

The built-in market actor currently occupies an exclusive position as the sole broker of
Filecoin Plus data cap, tightly coupled with the verified registry and storage miner actors.
In order to enable the development of useful storage-related applications and features,
we need to break the tight coupling between the built-in actors, expose composable on-chain primitives,
and make the capabilities of the built-in market actor available to user-programmable contracts.
This proposal addresses the capability to broker of Filecoin Plus data cap.

Breaking coupling between the built-in market actor, verified registry actor, and miner actors 
will eventually remove the storage market from consensus-critical risk surface,
and move subsequent market development into the realm of smart-contract upgrades,
rather than network-wide consensus protocol upgrades.
Minimising coupling is a key principle in software and systems engineering. 
Decoupling the verified data rewards from storage deals provides great opportunities for 
simplifying Filecoinâ€™s core mechanics in order to provide a better platform for development.

One benefit we can immediately realise is simplifying the calculation of quality-adjusted power. 
The current mechanism, which is coupled to deal terms, imposes significant limits on the flexibility of sector storage,
essentially rendering it write-once. 
Decoupling these neatly resolves the calculation difficulties to give full flexibility, 
and is much simpler than the Filecoin Plus premium proposal that also attempted this.

## Specification
**Terminology**
- *Allocation*: data cap allocated by a client to a specific piece of data.
- *Claim*: a provider's assertion they are storing all or part of an allocation
- *Term*: period of time for which a data cap allocation or claim is valid or active.

### Data cap allocations

The Filecoin Plus verified registry actor is extended to record allocations of data cap to specific
pieces of data to be stored by a provider. An allocation is independent of any deal with the
built-in storage market (or any future market).

```
struct Allocation {
    // The verified client which allocated the data cap.
    Client: Address
    // The provider (miner actor) which may claim the allocation.
    Provider: Address
    // Identifier of the data to be committed.
    Data: CID
    // The (padded) size of data.
    Size: uint64
    // The minimum duration which the provider must commit to storing the piece to avoid
    // early-termination penalties (epochs).
    TermMinimum: uint64
    // The maximum period for which a provider can earn quality-adjusted power 
    // for the piece (epochs).
    TermMaximum: uint64
    // The latest epoch by which a provider must commit data before the allocation expires.
    Expiration: Epoch
    // Whether the provider can commit the data in multiple pieces.
    // This is initially un-used, but supports allocations larger than a full sector in the future. 
    AllowRanges: bool
}
```

An allocation specifies a range of terms for which the provider may commit the data, between some
minimum and maximum. An allocation's maximum term must be at least as large as its minimum term.

Due to the implementation of term enforcement (details below), clients should leave a large buffer
between the minimum and maximum term to make the allocation practical for a provider.

**Parameters**

- The minimum allowed value for `TermMinimum` is 6 months.
- The maximum allowed value for `TermMaximum` is 5 years (can be increased by a future FIP).

Allocations are stored in the verified registry actor's state, grouped by client address.
Nesting by client promotes more efficient lookups at scale, 
and supports per-client iteration for revocation.

```
struct State {
    // ... Existing verified registry state ...
    
    // Allocations indexed by client, then by ID.
    Allocations: HAMT[Address]AMT[AllocationID]Allocation
	
    // Sequence number for allocation IDs.
    NextAllocationId: AllocationID // uint64
}
```

#### Operations

An allocation is created by a verified client by transferring data cap tokens (see below)
to the verified registry. 
The `Allocation` metadata must be provided as transfer metadata.
The verified registry checks the same preconditions as the existing `UseBytes` method. 
The size of the allocation must match the number of tokens received.

An allocation may be revoked after its expiration epoch has passed. 
When revoked, the data cap tokens are transferred back to the client.
The verified registry provides a new method to process revocations, replacing `RestoreBytes`.

```
struct RevokeExpiredAllocationsParams {
    Client: Address // client to clean up (need not be the caller)
    AllocationIDs: []AllocationID // empty for "all", or specify a set
}

// Removes all expired allocations for a client.
// The data cap for cleaned-up allocations is returned to the client.
// Note that un-expired allocations cannot be revoked.
fn RevokeAllocations(params: RevokeExpiredAllocationsParams)
```

Allocations are also removed when claimed by a provider (see below).

### Data cap claims

The verified registry actor is further extended to record each storage provider's commitment to a
data cap allocation, called a claim. A claim represents a provider's obligation to store a piece of
data, and corresponding benefit of incentivized storage power.

```
struct Claim {
    // The provider storing the data (from allocation).
    Provider: Address
    // The client which allocated the data cap (from allocation).
    Client: Address
    // Identifier of the data committed (from allocation).
    Data: CID
    // The (padded) size of data (from allocation).
    Size: uint64
    // The minimum period which the provider must commit to storing the piece (from allocation).
    TermMinimum: uint64
    // The maximum period for which the provider can earn QA-power for the piece (from allocation).
    TermMaximum: uint64
    // The epoch at which the (first range of the) piece was committed.
    TermStart: uint64
    // ID of the provider's sector in which the data is committed.
    Sector uint64
}
```

Claims are stored in the verified registry actor state, grouped by provider address. A claim's ID is
inherited from the allocation that created it.

```
struct State {
    // ... Existing verified registry state ...

    // Claims by provider ID, then Claim ID.
    Claims HAMT[Address]AMT[ClaimID]Claim
}
```

#### Operations
An allocation is claimed when a storage miner actor proves the corresponding piece of data 
is committed to a sector.

```
struct SectorAllocationClaim {
    // Client of the allocation being claimed.
    Client: Address
    // The allocation being claimed.
    AllocationID: AllocationID
    // The piece data committed (either the allocations data, or a part of it).
    PieceCID: CID
    // The (padded) size of the data committed (up to the allocation's data size).
    PieceSize: uint64
    // The sector into which the piece has been committed.
    SectorID: uint64
    // The epoch during which the sector is scheduled to expire.
    SectorExpiration: int64
 
}
struct ClaimAllocationsParams {
    Sectors: []SectorAllocationClaim
}
struct SectorClaimResult {
    // Count of successful claims.
    SuccessCount: uint64
    // Index and failure code for each unsuccessful claim.
    Failures: []{index: uint64, code: ExitCode}
}
// Called by storage miner actor to claim allocations for data provably committed to storage.
// For each allocation claim, the registry checks that the provided piece CID
// and size match that of the allocation.
fn ClaimAllocations(params: ClaimAllocationsParams) -> ClaimAllocationsResult
```

The record of a claim may be removed by the provider after the term maximum has elapsed.

```
struct RemoveExpiredClaimsParams {
    Provider: Address // provider to clean up (need not be the caller)
    ClaimIDs: []ClaimID // empty for "all", or specify a set
}

// Removes all (or specified) expired claims for a provider.
// Claims which have not yet passed their term maximum cannot be removed.
fn RemoveExpiredClaims(params: RemoveExpiredClaimsParams)
```


The maximum term for a claim may be increased by the client which originally made the allocation,
up to the network policy maximum.

A verified client can extend the term for a claim _beyond_ the initial maximum term by 
spending new data cap. 
The term maximum can be extended up to the network policy maximum beyond the current epoch.
The client extending the claim need not be the one that made the original allocation.
This is similar to issuing a new allocation for the same data, but avoids overheads of re-sealing.

```
struct ClaimTerm {
    Provider: Address // needed to find claim in state
    ClaimID: ClaimID
    TermMaximum: int64 // duration in epochs
}
struct ExtendClaimTermsParams{
    Claims: []ClaimTerm
}
struct ExtendClaimTermsResult {
    // Count of successful extensions.
    SuccessCount: uint64
    // Index and failure code for each unsuccessful extension.
    Failures: []{index: uint64, code: ExitCode}
}

// Called by allocation client to extend the maximum term of their allocations, 
// without consuming data cap.
// The new TermMaximum must be no less than the current one,
// and no greater than the maximum initial term.
fn ExtendClaimTerms(params: ExtendClaimTermsParams) -> ExtendClaimTermsResult
```

### Data cap token
The `Clients` map of addreses to balances is removed from the verified registry state.
The balances of data cap tokens held by verified clients are extracted to a data cap token actor.
This actor represents un-allocated data cap as a fungible token.
This token actor is intended to implement the FRC-0046 token standard in the future,
but specification of the full, public API is deferred to a subsequent proposal.
The data cap token actor should be retroactively updated to support the standard later.

Token balances are represented as BigIntegers with 18 decimal places of precision, 
a representation which is likely to be adopted by future token standards.
Token quantities are constrained to be whole multiples of `10^18`. 
One whole data cap token corresponds to one unit of data cap to be allocated,
which today is good for one byte of data.
The data cap token is generally non-transferable, except to or from the verified registry actor.
The token actor enforces these transfer restrictions.
The verified registry actor can invoke privileged methods to create and destroy tokens.

FRC-0046 supports delegation of control of token balances to specified third-party actors as "operators".
The built-in storage market actor is pre-authorized as an operator for all verified clients.
Thus, the built-in market actor can allocate data cap on clients' behalf.
This delegation mechanism will support user-programmed market actors dealing in data cap in the future.

This token delegation mechanism allows this proposal to be implemented without changing any
clients' or providers' workflows for existing functionality.
Parties will continue to interact with the built-in market actor and verified registry actor directly.

#### Operations
The `AddVerifiedClient` method is changed to invoke the data cap token actor to
mint new tokens to the client's balance.

The `UseBytes` method is removed.
To create an allocation, a verified client transfers data cap tokens to the verified registry actor.
The transfer must be accompanied by one or more `Allocation` records which specify 
the allocation(s) to create.
The registry may reject the transfer if the allocations are invalid.

The `RestoreBytes` method is also removed.
Instead, the `RevokeAllocations` method on the verified registry actor transfers any released
data cap tokens back to the client's balance for re-use.

### Simplified quality-adjusted power
A data cap allocation/claim is valid for a range of commitment terms, between a client-specified
minimum and maximum, so long as the allocation is claimed before the allocation expires.

The actual term for a claim begins at the epoch the data is committed into a sector,
proven either with proof-of-replication or replica-update. 
There is no distinct "deal start epoch".
A sector containing a data cap claim is immediately eligible for a power multiplier of 10 
for that fraction of the sector's capacity occupied by the incentivized data
(subject to the existing requirement to initially prove the sector in Window PoSt).

The actual term for a claim ends the epoch that the sector containing the data expires, 
or that data is replaced. 
The term cannot end during a sector's lifetime, except by explicit replacement of data.
If data is replaced, the sector immediately losses the power multiplier for that fraction
of the sector's capacity.
(Replacing non-zero data in a sector is not possible today).

Aligning the claim's term with the sector's expiration exactly in this way removes the
"spreading-out" of QA power over a sector's life in the current method of computation.
Providers gain 10x power for each byte of verified data exactly while that data is proven.
The miner actor computes a sectorâ€™s power as `SectorSize + (9 * VerifiedSize)`.

#### Pledge
A sector's pledge requirement is proportional to its share of power, but never decreases, just as today.
When the minimum term for a verified piece expires, the pledge requirement does not change.
The provider's commitment to storing the verified piece extends until 
the sector's scheduled expiration. 
If the sector is terminated early, the termination penalty is based on its boosted power.

If a verified piece is transferred to new sector (see below),
the new initial pledge for the new sector is calculated using the network conditions at the time,
including the sector's new power after adding the verified piece.
The pledge requirement for the old sector is not decreased, 
but any subsequent penalty is calculated using its current (i.e. reduced) power.

### Storage miner actor
The built-in miner actor is trusted to enforce the verified and the continual storage of the data.

The miner actor requires that the sector into which a claimed piece is committed must have a
**remaining lifespan that is sufficient to fulfil the minimum term**.
Thus, when a sector terminates at its scheduled expiration epoch, the claim's term has been met.

Similarly, the miner actor requires that sector into which the piece is committed must have a
**remaining lifespan no longer than that which would reach the maximum term**. 
That is, a sector's commitment expiration epoch must fall between the minimum and maximum terms
of any verified claim it holds.

The longest practical _minimum_ term for a verified data cap allocation is
the maximum initial sector commitment duration.

#### Failure and repair
There is **no change to termination penalty** calculations. 
If a sector is terminated early (continual faults, or manual termination),
the provider will pay a penalty related to the expected reward earned by the sector (up to some limit).

The verified registry can support re-commitment of the same data
(even though the built-in storage market actor does not support resumption of a terminated deal).
If a claimâ€™s maximum term has not been reached when a sector terminates,
the provider may commit the same piece into a new sector and regain the quality-adjusted power.
The new sectorâ€™s committed lifespan is still constrained to fit within the claimâ€™s term.

#### Sector extension
A provider cannot extend the scheduled expiration for a sector past the maximum term 
of any piece of verified data that it holds. 
The provider must forgo the verified power boost when processing such a sector extension. 
This does not reduce the sectorâ€™s pledge requirement, 
but does reduce penalties to be paid on any future fault to reflect the new, lower power.

This facility to drop a claim can only be exercised:
- for claims that have passed their minimum commitment,
- for non-faulty sectors, and
- in the final 30 days of the sector's currently committed lifespan

These restrictions prevent a provider using extension as a means of escaping their commitment to 
store the claimed piece for the sectorâ€™s full originally-committed lifetime.

The storage provider operator must provide the IDs of the allocations claimed by the sector when extending.

```
// The verified data claims currently supported by a sector, to be maintained or dropped
// while processing extension.
// All claims currently supported by the sector must be provided.
struct SectorClaims {
    Sector: uint64,
    MaintainClaims: []ClaimID
    DropClaims: []ClaimID
}
struct ExpirationExtension2 {
    Deadline: uint64,
    Partition: uint64,
    Sectors: BitField, // IDs of non-FIL+ sectors (must have zero verified deal weight)
    SectorsWithClaims: []SectorClaims
    NewExpiration: int64, // epoch
}
struct ExtendSectorExpirationParams2 {
    Extensions: []ExpirationExtension2,
}
struct ExtendSectorExpirationResult2 {
    // Count of successful extensions.
    SuccessCount: uint64
    // Index and failure code for each unsuccessful extension.
    Failures: []{index: uint64, code: ExitCode}
}

// Increases the expiration epoch for some sectors, optionally dropping expired claims.
// For each sector, the provided claim IDs must correspond to claims that refer back to the 
// sector, and the sum of their size must equal the sector's verified deal weight.
// The new expiration must be prior to the earliest term maximum for any maintained claims.
fn ExtendSectorExpiration2(params: ExtendSectorExpirationParams2) -> ExtendSectorExpirationResult2

```

### Built-in storage market as a delegate
The workflows described above are independent of any market actor, 
and take place through interactions by the client and provider with 
the verified registry actor directly.

However, in order to maintain current client and provider workflows, 
the built-in market actor can act as a delegate.

The built-in storage market actor is pre-authorized as a data cap token delegate for all clients.
When a deal proposal is published with `VerifiedDeal=true`, the market actor transfers
the corresponding data cap tokens from the client to the verified registry actor.
This transfer is accompanied by an `Allocation` record populated with data from the deal.
The built-in market specifies an allocation's minimum term to be equal to the deal duration,
and maximum term to be one year greater than the deal duration.

```
let dealAllocation = Allocation {
  Client: deal.Client
  Provider: deal.Provider
  Data: deal.PieceCID
  Size: deal.PieceSize
  TermMinimum: deal.EndEpoch - deal.StartEpoch
  TermMaximum: deal.EndEpoch - deal.StartEpoch + EPOCHS_IN_YEAR
  Expiration: deal.StartEpoch
  AllowRanges: false
  }
```

The market stores allocation IDs for not-yet-activated deals in a new mapping, 
and the claim ID for activated deals in deal state.

```
struct State {
  // Remainder unchanged...
  
  // Allocation IDs for deals that are not yet activated.
  PendingDealAllocationIDs CID // HAMT[DealID]AllocationID
}

struct DealState {
  // Existing state
  SectorStartEpoch: int64,
  LastUpdatedEpoch: int64,
  SlashEpoch: int64,
  // New
  ClaimID: uint64
}
```

When a verified deal expires without being committed, the data cap allocation remains.
The market does not revoke the allocation during cron handling.
Revocation is a manual operation that the client must perform.

When a verified deal is activated by the provider, the market actor returns 
the allocation ID and piece metadata to the storage miner actor.
The miner actor then invokes `ClaimAllocations` and, if successful,
computes quality adjusted power for the sector according to the piece size and QA power multiplier.

### Migration
TODO!

The power for existing sectors is not changed by this proposal.

A provider may opt-in to migrate a sector to the new QA power calculation method.
Each active deal is converted to a claim as if an allocation had been created when the deal was made.
The claim's minimum term is the deal's duration, and maximum term is the sector's current expiration epoch
(TODO: plus some buffer?).

Expired deals cannot be migrated, even though the old QA power calculation method has spread out
their power and reward over the sector's full lifetime.
This will generally result in an increase in power for a sector, 
but may result in a decrease in case of expired deals.
This is why the migration is opt-in.

A new method on the storage miner actor:
- Fetches information about each not-yet-expired verified deal from the market
- Calls the verified registry to create a claim for each such deal.
- Re-calculates power according to the amount of space committed to active claims. 
- Re-caclulates pledge requirement according to the new power and network conditions (but never decreases) 
 
After migration, the client can extend the migrated claims' terms up to the network policy maximum.
After claims are extended, the provider can extend the sector commitment duration to match.
Note that a migrated sector cannot be extended unless the claim terms are extended, 
lest it violate a claim's maximum term.

TODO:
- make third-party markets possible (after subsequent changes)
- allocations larger than sectors (and towards deals similar), scalable representation
- potential for direct route to FIL+ allocations (realised in next set of changes)


The pattern of proxying verified registry interactions through the built-in market actor will
initially raise the gas cost of deals, but this is a transitional state:

This proposal is a stepping stone toward greater potential gas efficiency of deals.
- For verified data where the client is offering no payment above the verified rewards, 
  no deal with a market will be necessary at all.
  A client need only make an allocation directly with the verified registry.
  This allocation is much cheaper to make and maintain than a deal.
- The proposed representations make possible data cap allocations larger than a single sector.
  As well as improvements in utility, such allocations will be far more gas efficient than
  negotiating a separate deal for each sector-sized unit.
- For deals where additional payment or terms are necessary, 
  this decoupling opens the potential to develop alternative storage markets, 
  including ones much more efficient than the built-in one.
  We can expect deal costs to decrease over time.

## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any core FIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the FIP is accepted. While there is merit to the approach of reaching consensus on the specification and rationale before writing code, the principle of "rough consensus and running code" is still useful when it comes to resolving many discussions of API details.-->
Implementation is in progress on the `decouple-fil+` branch of the built-in actors repository:
https://github.com/filecoin-project/builtin-actors/tree/decouple-fil+.
