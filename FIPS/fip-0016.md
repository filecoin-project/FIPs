## Simple Summary

Filecoin alleviate penalty during the period of specified start height and end height

## Abstract

This FIP will define two network upgrade points, after the start height, the missing window post penalty will be reduced to a reasonable level to keep the miner from broke, and the 14 days sector termination will be suspended. after the end height, the penalty fee and the termination will be back to normal

## Change Motivation

Chinese Vice Premier called for crackdown on cryptocurrency mining in 5/21. As follow up instructions to IDCs might come up from the government really soon, there could be risk that IDCs to cutoff infrastructure supplies for hosted filecoin nodes in China in a matter of days, this will be a massive hit on nodes hosted in China and will be a huge hit for filecoin network as well permanency. As an prepared emergency remediation for that worst case scenario, we propose an intermediate period for those nodes to migrate to oversea and their power can be allowed to come back afterward.

## Specification

As for now missing window post will lead to 4.5 BR from the second time, and the sectors will be terminated after 14 days missing in a row. Propose to change it to xxx BR, and suspend the 14 days termination time frame. There will be two network upgrade required. First one will use the new penalty setup as proposed above, the second one will resume the current penalty setup including the penalty fees and 14 days penalty. No state migration is required as no new field or method will be introduced by this FIP.

Parameters:
TBD

## Test Cases

## Summary of security considerations

## Product Considerations

The network should accept this FIP after PL and community jointly determine that more than 50% network storage power will be cut and can't be restored until at least in 2 weeks.
This FIP shall be marked as obsolete as long as a follow up FIP which allow miners to choose their own maintenance window has been implemented.

## Implementation
