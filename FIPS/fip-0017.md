## Simple Summary

A protocol for updating any sector with new data without re-sealing.

## Abstract

The intuition is that the miner "xor"-s (techically field addition) the new data with some unpredictable randomness into the last layer of the Proof of Replication.

The miner generates three messages:

* Declares an update with `DeclareUpdate` with the new deals
* Gets the encoding randomness from the chain and generates a `PreCommitReplicaUpdate`
* Gets the challenges seed from the chain and generates `ProveCommitReplicaUpdate`

## Change Motivation

Since 90+% of sectors in the Filecoin Network are CC sectors, having a protocol that allows for updating CC sectors to store real data without incurring in a full re-sealing would massively improve our network in terms of the amount of real data stored through it. 

1. It would allow **decoupling sealing latency from deal-making speed** - offering storage clients an improved experience for how quickly their data can land in on-chain deals
2. It would **unlock the 8EiB of storage already committed to the Filecoin network** to be quickly used for deals - enabling a 100PiB+ client to make deals for their entire dataset with a single miner like [f0127595](https://filfox.info/en/address/f0127595) which already has 120PiB of committed capacity.
3. It makes **utilizing existing committed capacity much cheaper for miners** (since they’ve already invested the sealing cost), increasing the chances they pay clients to add FIL+ data to these sectors.

What this FIP does not support (see Future Work section)

* Deal updates
* Moving deals across sectors

## Specification

### Three-messages Update Protocol

1. **Miner publishes `Miner.DeclareUpdate(deals []DealID, sectorId SectorID)`**:
   1. Input
      1. `deals` is the full list of deals
   2. Validity
      1. Fail if caller is not a worker account
      2. Fail if miner is in debt
      3. Fails if miner has deals in the sector ID which are not in `deals` and that have not expired yet.
   3. Collaterals
      1. Requires deposit of `SectorUpdateDeposit`
      2. Requires deposit of new deal collateral and new initial pledge based on the new deals
   4. Side effects
      1. Stores `deals` for this sector in the actor (TODO: we must extend the miner actor to support this)
      2. Commits the miner to complete the update protocol, failure to do so by a certain time will make the miner lose the deposit. That time is: `currentEpoch + SectorUpdateExpiry`.
2. **Miner runs `ReplicaUpdate` routine**:
   1. Gets `SectorUpdateRandomness` from the declared update epoch plus `PreCommitReplicaUpdateRandDelay` epochs
   2. Evaluates the replica `newReplica[i] = Enc(sectorKey[i], data[i], rand)`, where
      1. `newReplica` is the vector of `Fr` elements of the new replica
      2. `sectorKey` is the vector of `Fr` elements of the last layer of the sealing process
      3. `data` is the vector of `Fr` elements of the deals data ordered and padded as done in the sealing subroutine
      4. `rand` is the `SectorUpdateRandomness`
   3. Generate a new commitment `UpdatingSectorCID`
3. **Miner publishes `PreCommitReplicaUpdate(rui ReplicaUpdateInfo)`**
   1. Input
      1. `rui.SealedSectorCID`
      2. (TODO: check what other inputs are needed)
   2. Side effects
      1. Store the new commitment on-chain (TODO: define where this should happen)
4. **Miner runs `ReplicaUpdateProve` routine**
   1. Let `seed = SectorUpdateProveSeed`, taken from precommit epoch plus `PreCommitReplicaUpdateChallengeDelay`.
   2. Let `rand = SectorUpdateRandomness`, taken from declare update epoch plus `ProveCommitReplicaUpdateRandDelay`
   3. Generate a SNARK that proves
      1. For challenge `i=0..SectorUpdateProveChallenges`,  `c = ChallengeGen(seed, i)`
         1. Encoding: we have that `newReplica[c] = Enc(sectorKey[c], data[c], rand)`
         2. Inclusion proofs:
            1. `newReplica[c]` is the opening of `UpdatingSectorCID` at position `c`
            2. `sectorKey[c]` is the opening of `CommRLast` from `SealedSectorCID` at position `c`
            3. `data[c]` is the opening of `UnsealedSectorCID` at position `c`
      2. The following was correctly computed`newReplica[c] = Enc(sectorKey[c], data[c], seed)`
5. **Miner publishes `Miner.ProveCommitReplicaUpdate(proof)`**:
   1. Verify the proof of correct data update:
      1. Generate challenges from  `SectorUpdateRandomness`
      2. Get `SectorUpdateProveSeed` (`seed`)
      3. Get `UpdatingSectorCID` commitment for this sector 
      4. Get `deals` for this sector and generate `UnsealedSectorCID` from the CIDs of the deals
      5. Verify that `proof` is valid for using inputs: `SectorUpdateRandomness`, `SectorUpdateSeed`, `UpdatingSectorCID`, `Challenges`
   2. Collateral:
      1. Return `SectorUpdateDeposit`
   3. Side effects:
      1. Update `SealedSectorCID` with `UpdatingSectorCID`
      2. TODO: Remove book keeping for the in-progress update
      3. TODO: Keep the last DeclareUpdate epoch to simplify future retrieval

### Retrieving updated data

1. From the `replica`:
   1. Get `SectorUpdateRandomness` for the last `DeclareUpdate`
   2. Regenerate `sectorKey` by re-sealing the sector
   3. For each `i`: `Dec(sectorKey[i], replica[i], rand)`

### Algorithms

### Encoding

The current encoding algorithm is the following:

 `Enc(sectorKey[i], data[i], rand) = sectorKey[i] + data[i] * rand`

Note that it requires re-encoding the entire sector with the new randomness.

See future work on how to improve this.

## Design Rationale

### Parameters choice

* `PreCommitReplicaUpdateRandDelay`: 150 epochs
  * `PreCommitReplicaUpdateRandDelay > Finality` in order to avoid miner to adaptively choose data Ddeals (can be 150-300 epochs)
* `ProveCommitReplicaUpdateChallengeDelay`: 150 epochs
  * `ProveCommitReplicaUpdateChallengeDelay> Finality` in order to avoid miner to be able to do long forks to grind better challenges
* `SectorUpdateProveChallenges`: (TODO choose number of challenges)

TODO

### Pledge

- **SectorUpdateDeposit**: `DeclareUpdate` requires a pledge which covers both `PreCommitReplicaUpdate` (to ensure that they cannot grind on data) and `ProveCommitReplicaUpdate` (to ensure that they cannot grind on on-chain randomness) and it is given back at `ProveCommitReplicaUpdate`
- **InitialPledge**: We must update the IP of the sector based on its new QA Power. (TODO: explain why and when)

## Backwards Compatibility

All sectors can be upgraded.

### Breaking immutability of sectors and deals



## Test Cases

TODO

## Security Considerations

### Loosing epsilon-Replication guarantees

This changes changes the security property of Filecoin. Retrievability of the files and space-hardness are still guaranteed. TODO: expand on this.

## Incentive Considerations

TODO

## Product Considerations

TODO

## Implementation

- TODO: Initial Pledge should be updated in one of the new methods, we believe it should be PreCommit.
- TODO: How do we best represent deals in Declare update? Do we relist all the deals or we show a diff of deals?
- TODO: If we were to do 10x the snark (which shouldn’t be a big burden) we can remove the PreCommit step and fold it into ProveCommit - is this something that we should try doing?

## Future work

* DeclareDeals to support deal transfer: allow moving deals from sector to sector
* CapacityDeals: allow purchasing a capacity of the storage of a miner instead of the storage of a specific deal
* Update protocol that does not require to perform an operation on a full sector.
* DealUpdates: a license to terminate a deal in place for a new one (e.g. a user wants to update a portion of their files)
