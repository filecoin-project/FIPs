## Simple Summary

Miner can be actively choose their "maintenance" window, by send a "pause" message to put their power offline, later can send a "resume" message to go back to normal operation,

## Abstract

This FIP will allow the miner to choose their maintenance window by two miner actor methods, the power will be zeroed out as soon as the "pause" message is received, a window post is required to restore their power after "resume" message is received by the network.

## Change Motivation

Chinese Vice Premier called for crackdown on cryptocurrency mining in 5/21. As follow up instructions to IDCs might come up from the government really soon, there could be risk that IDCs to cutoff infrastructure supplies for hosted filecoin nodes in China in a matter of days, considering other nature disaster like tornado or earthquake which might threat mine operation but the sealed data is still have a good chance to preserved, this FIP allow miner to choose a maintenance window to alleviate the penalty and can bring back their power later.

## Specification

Two new methods -"pause" and "resume", and "pause mode" and "extend termination pledge" field are introduced in miner actor. 

pause method: zeroed out all power from the miner immediately, "pause mode" is set to true. mining block is prohibited immediately, a parameter of "extend termination pledge" can be specified by the miner, and the amount will be transfer ed from miner's availability to "extend termination pledge" field. A constant "pause fee" (xxxxBR) will be used to calculate the penalty per day instead of 3.51 BR, sectors termination time frame will be extend to 14 days + "extend termination pledge"/("pause fee" * total quality power of the miner). After 14 days in pause mode, "extend termination pledge" amount will be transferred ("pause fee" * total quality power of the miner) to f099 every day. All methods except resume method is prohibited.

resume method: reset "pause mode" to false, zeroed out "extend termination pledge", the power is remained zero before next successful post.

Network version upgrade and migration will be required.
