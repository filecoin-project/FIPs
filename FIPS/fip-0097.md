# FIP-0097: Add Support for EIP-1153 (Transient Storage) in the FEVM

## Simple Summary
This proposal introduces support for **[EIP-1153: Transient Storage](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1153)** in the Filecoin Ethereum Virtual Machine (FEVM). Transient storage provides data storage during transaction execution, scoped strictly to the transaction and the contract utilizing it. To maintain compatibility with Ethereum contracts utilizing this feature, the FEVM will implement transient storage with lifecycle validation and isolation.

## Abstract
EIP-1153 defines transient storage as temporary data accessible only during the originating transaction, cleared automatically at the end of the transaction. This FIP adapts transient storage to the FEVM using `TLOAD` and `TSTORE` opcodes, ensuring compatibility with Ethereum contracts and libraries that rely on this feature. Transient storage is scoped to the specific contract and transaction, ensuring that each contract’s transient storage is isolated. Nested contract calls cannot access the transient storage of other contracts, but reentrant calls to the same contract within a transaction will access the same transient storage space. Lifecycle validation mechanisms enforce this behavior, achieving functional equivalence with Ethereum’s implementation while maintaining seamless integration with Filecoin’s architecture.

## Change Motivation
Transient storage offers developers temporary, transaction-scoped storage for managing intermediate states. One key benefit of this feature is its ability to improve the implementation of reentrancy locks, enhancing security by mitigating risks associated with multiple calls to a function within sub-transactions. This feature was introduced on Ethereum mainnet in March 2024 as part of the Cancun (Dencun) upgrade, making adopting this FIP important to align the FEVM with Ethereum’s evolving tooling and Solidity’s modern features. By implementing transient storage, the FEVM ensures a seamless developer experience while supporting advanced contract use cases and secure computing.

While the FEVM implementation utilizes permanent storage for practical reasons, its lifecycle validation ensures it functionally replicates Ethereum’s transient storage. This enables compatibility with contracts and libraries that rely on `TLOAD` and `TSTORE` while supporting transaction-scoped data handling.

## Specification

### Opcode Descriptions

#### `TLOAD`
- **Opcode Hex:** `0x5C`
- **Stack Input:**
  - `key`: Location of the transient storage value to load
- **Stack Output:**
  - `value`: Stored value or zero if no value exists
- **Description:**
  - Retrieves the value associated with `key` in transient storage.
  - If the transaction has ended, transient storage is cleared, and `TLOAD` returns zero.

#### `TSTORE`
- **Opcode Hex:** `0x5D`
- **Stack Input:**
  - `key`: Location to store the value
  - `value`: Value to store
- **Output:** None
- **Description:**
  - Stores `value` at the specified `key` in transient storage.
  - Data is cleared at the end of the transaction.


### Lifecycle Management
Transient storage is valid only within a single transaction. The system enforces this behavior by:

- **Tracking `origin` and `nonce`**: Each transient storage slot is associated with the transaction’s origin actor and nonce.
- **Resetting Storage on New Transactions**: If a new transaction begins, previous transient storage data is discarded.
- **Allowing Reentrancy**: If a contract calls itself within a transaction, it retains access to the same transient storage.

At the implementation level, transient storage is managed via `StateKamt<U256, U256>`, ensuring transaction-scoped isolation.

### Implementation Details
The FEVM implements transient storage (`TLOAD` and `TSTORE`) using an internal lifecycle validation mechanism. This ensures that transient storage remains scoped to the transaction and is automatically cleared once execution ends.

##### Data Structures
The implementation introduces the following Rust data structures:

- **`TransientData`**: Stores the transient storage state for a contract within a transaction.
- **`TransientDataLifespan`**: Tracks the lifespan of transient storage using the `origin` actor ID and `nonce` of the transaction.

```rust
pub struct TransientData {
    pub transient_data_state: Cid,  // CID of the transient storage map
    pub transient_data_lifespan: TransientDataLifespan, // Lifecycle validation
}

pub struct TransientDataLifespan {
    pub origin: ActorID,  // Origin actor ID
    pub nonce: u64,  // Unique transaction identifier
}
```

##### Storage and Lifecycle Enforcement
The FEVM utilizes **persistent storage** to back transient data but enforces strict lifecycle rules to ensure it behaves like Ethereum's transient storage. The system:

1. **Checks Transaction Context**:
   - Before every `TLOAD` or `TSTORE` operation, the contract verifies the transaction’s `origin` and `nonce` to ensure validity.

2. **Clears Storage at Transaction End**:
   - If a new transaction begins, the system resets the `TransientData` state, ensuring no data persists across transactions.

3. **Handles Reentrant Calls**:
   - If a contract invokes itself within the same transaction, transient storage remains available.

---

## Design Rationale

The design adheres to the intent of EIP-1153 while adapting to Filecoin's architecture. The use of lifecycle validation ensures transient storage behaves as expected within the scope of a single transaction. This approach balances compatibility with Ethereum contracts and simplifies implementation within the existing FEVM architecture. 

Alternative designs, such as purely in-memory storage, were considered but deemed impractical due to technical implementation difficulties.

## Backwards Compatibility
The addition of transient storage is fully backward-compatible. Existing contracts remain unaffected unless they utilize `TLOAD` and `TSTORE`. Contracts compiled with older Solidity versions will continue to execute without changes.

At the time of writing, support for `TLOAD` and `TSTORE` in current versions of Solidity is only available using inline-assembly. Thus, it is an explicitly opt-in feature, rather than a feature that contract authors may unknowngly be enabling when bumping compiler version and EVM target.

## Test Cases

##### **1. Basic Functionality**
- Verify `TLOAD` retrieves the correct value.
- Verify `TSTORE` writes data to transient storage.
- Verify `TLOAD` from an uninitialized location returns zero.

##### **2. Lifecycle Validation**
- Verify transient storage is **cleared** at the end of a transaction.
- Verify **reentrant calls** access the same transient storage space.
- Verify **nested contract calls** have independent transient storage.

##### **3. Cross-Contract Isolation**
- Deploy two contracts, `A` and `B`.
- Have contract `A` write to transient storage.
- Have contract `B` attempt to access `A`'s transient storage.
- Verify that `B` cannot read `A`'s transient storage.

##### **4. Handling Reverted Transactions**
- Store a value in transient storage.
- Revert the transaction before it completes.
- Verify that no transient storage data persists.

## Security Considerations
Transient storage introduces security considerations, primarily around ensuring that data does not persist beyond the transaction. To mitigate risks:

1. **Automatic Clearing at Transaction End**
   - Transient storage is reset when a new transaction starts.
   - Even if the contract does not explicitly clear storage, the FEVM enforces reset.

2. **Preventing Cross-Contract Leakage**
   - Contracts cannot access transient storage from other contracts.
   - Each contract’s transient storage is isolated by its execution context.

3. **Reentrancy Safety**
   - Contracts can safely store temporary data within a transaction.

## Incentive Considerations
By adding support for transient storage, this FIP improves the FEVM's compatibility with Ethereum and provides developers with useful functionality for transaction-scoped data handling. This feature enables capabilities outlined in EIP-1153, such as reentrancy locks, temporary approvals, on-chain address computation, and enhanced proxy call metadata handling. These improvements align with Filecoin's goal of enabling scalable and reliable decentralized applications. However, transient storage does not introduce or impact economic incentives within the network.

## Product Considerations
Adding transient storage ensures compatibility with modern Ethereum tooling, attracting developers to Filecoin’s ecosystem. This feature supports the development of advanced smart contracts and storage-related services. This addition further solidifies Filecoin’s position as a robust EVM-compatible chain, enhancing its attractiveness to Ethereum developers and expanding its ecosystem of decentralized applications.
