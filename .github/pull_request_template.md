## Are you drafting a new FIP?
Please follow these guidelines to help ensure that your proposal is set up for success in the governance process.

### Open a discussion topic
Changes to the Filecoin core protocol proceed through open discussion.
Please open a new discussion topic in the FIPs repository discussion board and outline you motivation and proposal.

The FIP format is suitable for specifying a concrete protocol change for implementation, 
but your discussion post should describe more of the background and problem to be solved,
outline a range of approaches and their tradeoffs, and invite participants to explore other solutions.

Historically, failing to gain some community buy-in before submitting a FIP has often resulted in 
rejected FIPs and much wasted effort.

### Please use the template
Please draft your FIP by starting with an appropriate template file from templates directory.
Do not significantly change the header table format or section headings.

### Don't claim a FIP number
FIP numbers are allocated by the FIP editors when a draft is ready to be merged into the master branch.
The editors coordinate to ensure allocations to in-flight drafts don't collide.
Please do not allocate yourself a FIP number.

Name your file `fip-my_draft_title.md` (replacing the suffix with an abbreviated title)
and leave "to be assigned" for the FIP number in the header table.
A FIP editor will either inform you of the appropriate number, or insert it themselves when merging.

### Please add your FIP to the README
The top-level README.md file contains a table of all FIPs.
Please add yours there in the same PR that adds the FIP draft itself.
Use XXXX for the FIP number until it is assigned by an editor.

### Delete this guidance and describe your FIP
Once you've followed the guidance above and are ready to submit your FIP draft,
please delete this text and replace it with a copy of the _Abstract_ from your draft, 
and a link to the relevant discussion forum topic.
