Just as the original process is inspired by the [Ethereum EIPs repo](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPS/), some of the Jekyll layouts have been forked from there.

## Theme

The theme is [mmistakes/jekyll-theme-basically-basic](https://github.com/mmistakes/jekyll-theme-basically-basic) installed as a gem-based theme. If you want to more drastically override the current theme, copy in the file from the original theme and modify it.

## Development

This is a standard Jekyll site.

1. Install via `bundle install`
2. Run a local server with `bundle exec jekyll serve`

This can be built with Github Pages, but is currently set up to build using Fleek.

PRs have builds automatically created, so that FIPs creators can see how their pages will be rendered.
