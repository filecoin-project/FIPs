## Filecoin Improvement Protocol

The Filecoin Improvement Protocol contains the set of fundamental governing principles for the Filecoin Network. It outlines the vision for Filecoin and the principles, processes, and parties involved in making decisions that affect the future of the network. It also describes how improvements to these rules can be proposed and ratified.


## The Filecoin Vision

Filecoin is a peer-to-peer network that stores files, with built-in economic incentives to ensure that files are stored reliably over time. Its mission is to create a decentralized, efficient and robust foundation for humanity’s information. To advance that mission, Filecoin has created a decentralized storage network that lets anyone in the world store or retrieve files. 

In Filecoin, users pay to store their files on storage miners. Storage miners are computers responsible for storing files and proving they have stored the files correctly over time. Anyone who wants to store their files or get paid for storing other users’ files can join Filecoin. Available storage and pricing are not controlled by any single entity. Instead, Filecoin facilitates open markets for storing and retrieving files that anyone can participate in, thereby providing storage to billions of people who are currently locked out of the web.

## Filecoin Design Principles

The design of Filecoin is intended to follow a set of principles. The community will help define these principles in the coming months.


## Filecoin Improvement Principles

When making decisions about how to improve Filecoin, we will follow a set of principles. The community will help define these principles in the coming months.


## Making changes to the Filecoin network

[Filecoin Improvement Proposals (FIPs)](https://github.com/filecoin-project/FIPs/blob/master/FIPS/fip-0001.md) are the primary mechanism by which the Filecoin community can submit, discuss, and approve changes relevant to the Filecoin network. These discussions and decisions should be guided by the governance and design principles above.

FIPs are classified into three categories:

**Technical FIPs, or Filecoin Technical Proposals (FTPs)** are designed to gather community feedback on technical Filecoin issues. These include changes to the Filecoin protocol, a change in block or transaction validity rules, and proposed application standards or conventions. They are then reviewed by the Filecoin community and the technical steering committee.

**Organizational FIPs, or Filecoin Organization Proposals (FOPs)** allow the Filecoin community to propose, discuss, and achieve consensus on Filecoin governance. This includes procedures, guidelines, decision-making processes, and changes to the FIP or FRP processes.

**Recovery FIPs, or Filecoin Recovery Proposals (FRPs)** are intended to provide the Filecoin community with a forum to raise, discuss, and achieve consensus on fault recovery and chain rewrites, under a very limited, clearly-defined set of criteria (ex, in the case of protocol bugs destroying network value). The community will help define this process as needed in the coming months.



## A decentralized, global network

Filecoin is still in its infancy, but it has the potential to play a central role in the storage and distribution of humanity’s information. To help the network grow and evolve, it is critical for the community to collectively be engaged in proposing, discussing, and implementing changes that improve the network and its operations. 

These governance rules are critical to achieving that objective, and we invite the Filecoin community to join us in the journey we have ahead of us.
